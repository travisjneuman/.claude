## Skill Gap Analysis

### Gap Analysis Methodology

```
STEP 1: Define target role
  - Job title and level
  - 3-5 real job postings as reference
  - Extract required skills, qualifications, experience

STEP 2: Map current state
  - Complete skills audit (above)
  - List current qualifications and credentials
  - Quantify years of relevant experience

STEP 3: Identify gaps
  For each target role requirement:
    HAVE IT: Skill present and at required level
    PARTIAL: Skill present but below required level
    MISSING: Skill not present, needs development
    ADJACENT: Have related skill, needs pivot

STEP 4: Prioritize gaps
  Priority = (Importance to target role) x (Size of gap)
  Focus on HIGH importance + LARGE gap first
```

### Gap Prioritization Matrix

| | Small Gap | Large Gap |
|--|-----------|-----------|
| **High Importance** | Quick win — close fast | Critical path — invest heavily |
| **Low Importance** | Defer — nice to have | Ignore — not worth the effort |

### Common Skill Development Paths

| Gap Type | Timeline | Methods |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Technical certification** | 1-3 months | Online course + exam |
| **New programming language** | 2-4 months | Project-based learning |
| **Domain knowledge** | 3-6 months | Reading, mentorship, side projects |
| **Leadership experience** | 6-12 months | Volunteer to lead, manage projects |
| **Industry transition** | 12-24 months | Networking, bridge roles, education |
| **Advanced degree** | 1-3 years | Part-time programs, employer sponsorship |
