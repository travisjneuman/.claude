<objective>
Verify and polish generic-code-reviewer skill to serve as quality benchmark.

Purpose: The generic-code-reviewer at 105 lines is already solid. This plan validates it against Phase 1 templates/checklist and makes minor enhancements to serve as the benchmark for other skills.
Output: Enhanced generic-code-reviewer SKILL.md with explicit P0/P1/P2 structure, judgment calls section, and verified activation.

**Phase 1 templates for reference:**
@.planning/templates/skill-enhancement-template.md
@.planning/templates/skill-quality-checklist.md

**Shared standards (enhanced in Phase 1):**
@skills/_shared/CODE_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md

**Current skill to enhance:**
@skills/generic-code-reviewer/SKILL.md

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- Three distinct templates by skill type (use Template B: Code Review Skills)
- P0/P1/P2 tiered checklist prevents instruction overload
- Lean shared standards (<150 lines each) for token efficiency

**Quality benchmark established:**
- generic-code-reviewer is cited as "good example at 104 lines" in checklist
- This plan validates and enhances it to serve as reference for Phase 4 stack variants

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Validate current skill against P0 checklist</name>
  <files>skills/generic-code-reviewer/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Run P0 (Must Pass) validation from skill-quality-checklist.md:

1. **Activation Quality:**
   - Check description is task-focused with capabilities
   - Verify natural language triggers included
   - Confirm under 1024 characters

2. **Structure Compliance:**
   - Verify under 500 lines (currently 105 - OK)
   - YAML frontmatter complete

3. **Anti-Pattern Check:**
   - No padding/filler
   - No theory without application
   - No instruction overload (>10 flat items)
   - No vague guidance

Document any P0 failures that need fixing.
  </action>
  <verify>P0 checklist completed, issues documented if any</verify>
  <done>All P0 items checked, issues list created (or confirmed zero issues)</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Enhance skill with explicit P0/P1/P2 structure</name>
  <files>skills/generic-code-reviewer/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Enhance the skill following Template B (Code Review Skills):

1. **Add explicit P0/P1/P2 labels** to existing sections:
   - Security checks → Label as P0 (Block Merge)
   - Performance/accessibility → Label as P1 (Should Fix)
   - Code quality polish → Label as P2 (Nice to Have)

2. **Add Judgment Calls section** (from template):
   - Production vs prototype context
   - Hot path vs one-time setup
   - Public API vs internal helper
   - How to adjust expectations

3. **Add Review Output Format** (if missing):
   - Only report issues found
   - P0/P1/P2 format for flagging
   - Success message format

4. **Verify references to shared standards:**
   - CODE_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md link correct
   - DESIGN_PATTERNS.md link correct

Keep under 150 lines total (target: ~130 lines for headroom).
Maintain backward compatibility - don't change activation or core content.
  </action>
  <verify>wc -l skills/generic-code-reviewer/SKILL.md shows under 150 lines, P0/P1/P2 labels visible in content</verify>
  <done>Skill enhanced with explicit priorities, judgment calls section, under 150 lines</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Run P1 validation and document benchmark</name>
  <files>skills/generic-code-reviewer/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Run P1 (Expert Quality) validation:

1. **Framework Coverage:**
   - Has tech stack detection table - CHECK
   - Has specific thresholds (bundle sizes, contrast ratios) - CHECK
   - Has tiered priorities - VERIFY after Task 2 edits

2. **Actionable Guidance:**
   - Templates included (checklist format) - CHECK
   - Specific thresholds provided - CHECK
   - Decision trees (judgment calls) - VERIFY after Task 2

3. **Quality Mechanisms:**
   - References shared standards - CHECK
   - Output format specified - VERIFY after Task 2

Document the skill as Phase 2 benchmark in summary with specific line counts and features that make it exemplary.
  </action>
  <verify>P1 checklist completed (80%+ items checked), benchmark documentation prepared</verify>
  <done>Skill validated as expert quality, ready to serve as benchmark for stack variants</done>
</task>
