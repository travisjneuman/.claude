## Needs Assessment Methodology

### Building a Compelling Case

```
NEEDS ASSESSMENT COMPONENTS:

1. QUANTIFY THE PROBLEM
   - Use local, state, and national data
   - Cite authoritative sources (CDC, Census, WHO, peer-reviewed)
   - Show trends (is the problem growing?)
   - Compare to benchmarks or averages

   Example: "In Jefferson County, 34% of children under 5 live in
   food-insecure households, compared to the state average of 19%
   and national average of 16% (USDA, 2024)."

2. DEFINE THE TARGET POPULATION
   - Demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, income)
   - Geographic location
   - Size of population affected
   - Specific vulnerabilities or barriers

3. DOCUMENT THE GAP
   - What services/solutions currently exist?
   - Where do they fall short?
   - What populations are underserved?
   - What evidence supports the proposed approach?

4. ESTABLISH URGENCY
   - Consequences of inaction
   - Time-sensitive factors
   - Tipping points or windows of opportunity
   - Cost of not acting vs. cost of intervention
```

### Data Sources for Needs Statements

| Data Type | Sources | Strength |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Demographic** | US Census, ACS, BLS | Authoritative, granular |
| **Health** | CDC WONDER, BRFSS, NHANES | National benchmarks |
| **Education** | NCES, state report cards | School/district level |
| **Economic** | BLS, BEA, FRED | Employment, income data |
| **Community** | Community needs assessments | Local relevance |
| **Qualitative** | Focus groups, interviews, surveys | Lived experience |
| **Organizational** | Internal program data | Demonstrates capacity |

## Logic Model / Theory of Change

### Logic Model Template

```
LOGIC MODEL:

INPUTS           ACTIVITIES         OUTPUTS          SHORT-TERM        LONG-TERM
(Resources)      (What you do)      (Products)       OUTCOMES          OUTCOMES
                                                     (1-3 years)      (3-5+ years)
-----------      -----------        ---------        -----------       -----------
Funding          Job training       # trained        Increased         Reduced
Staff            workshops          # workshops      employment        poverty rate
Volunteers       Case management    # served         rate
Partners         Mentoring          # mentor         Higher            Improved
Facilities       Job placement      matches          income            community
Curriculum       Follow-up          # placed                           economic
                 support                             Improved          health
                                                     job retention

ASSUMPTIONS:
  - Target population will engage in programming
  - Local employers will participate in placement
  - Participants have baseline qualifications
  - Economic conditions remain stable

EXTERNAL FACTORS:
  - Labor market conditions
  - Policy/regulatory changes
  - Community support
  - Competing programs
```

### Theory of Change Narrative

```
TEMPLATE:

IF we provide [ACTIVITIES] to [TARGET POPULATION],
THEN [SHORT-TERM OUTCOMES] will occur,
BECAUSE [EVIDENCE/MECHANISM],
WHICH WILL LEAD TO [LONG-TERM OUTCOMES].

EXAMPLE:
"If we provide intensive digital literacy training combined with
personalized job coaching to 200 unemployed adults in rural
Appalachia, then participants will develop marketable technology
skills and secure employment within 6 months, because research
demonstrates that combined skills training and individualized
support produces employment rates 40% higher than training alone
(Smith et al., 2023), which will lead to increased household
income and reduced regional poverty over 3-5 years."
```

## SMART Objectives

### Writing SMART Objectives

| Component | Definition | Test Question |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Specific** | Clearly defined and unambiguous | What exactly will change? For whom? |
| **Measurable** | Quantifiable indicator of success | How will you know it was achieved? |
| **Achievable** | Realistic given resources and context | Can this actually be accomplished? |
| **Relevant** | Aligned with needs and funder priorities | Does this address the stated need? |
| **Time-bound** | Clear deadline or timeframe | By when will this be achieved? |

### Objective Examples

```
WEAK OBJECTIVE:
  "Improve health outcomes for community members."

STRONG OBJECTIVE:
  "By September 30, 2027, 75% of the 200 enrolled participants
   will demonstrate a reduction in systolic blood pressure of at
   least 10 mmHg, as measured by quarterly clinical assessments."

GOAL vs OBJECTIVE:
  Goal: Reduce food insecurity in Jefferson County
  Objective 1: By Month 12, establish 3 new community food
    pantries serving 500 households per month
  Objective 2: By Month 18, 80% of enrolled families will report
    increased access to fresh produce (pre/post survey)
  Objective 3: By Month 24, reduce the percentage of food-insecure
    children in target ZIP codes from 34% to 25%

| **Outcome** | Results and impact | Did participants improve? Were objectives met? | Pre/post assessments, comparison groups, surveys |
| **Impact** | Long-term change | Did the intervention cause the observed change? | Quasi-experimental, longitudinal, RCT |
| **Formative** | Ongoing improvement | What's working? What needs adjustment? | Focus groups, rapid feedback, CQI data |
| **Summative** | Final assessment | Was the project successful overall? | Final data analysis, cost-effectiveness |

### Evaluation Matrix Template

```
EVALUATION MATRIX:

| Objective | Indicator | Data Source | Collection Method | Frequency | Target |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|-----------|--------|

```

## Funder Alignment Strategies

### Matching Funder Priorities

```
ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS:

Step 1: Read the RFP/RFA closely
  - Highlight stated priorities and preferred approaches
  - Note required elements and formats
  - Identify scoring criteria and weights
  - Note any absolute requirements (deal-breakers)

Step 2: Map your project to funder language
  - Use their terminology (not yours)
  - Reference their strategic plan or theory of change
  - Cite their previously funded projects as models
  - Address every stated priority explicitly

Step 3: Mirror the scoring rubric
  - Structure your proposal to match evaluation criteria
  - Ensure every scored element is clearly addressed
  - Front-load the most heavily weighted criteria
  - Use their section headings when possible
```

## Proposal Writing Tips

```
WRITING PRINCIPLES:

1. LEAD WITH IMPACT
   "This project will reduce childhood food insecurity by 30%"
   NOT "This project proposes to address food insecurity issues"

2. SHOW, DON'T TELL
   "In 2024, our program placed 142 adults in jobs with an average
    starting wage of $19.50/hour, exceeding our target by 18%"
   NOT "Our organization has extensive experience in job placement"

3. ONE IDEA PER PARAGRAPH
   Each paragraph should have a clear topic sentence
   and supporting evidence

4. USE ACTIVE VOICE
   "The Program Director will coordinate all partner activities"
   NOT "All partner activities will be coordinated"

5. QUANTIFY EVERYTHING
   "serve 200 families" not "serve many families"
   "$15/hour" not "a competitive wage"
   "within 6 months" not "in a timely manner"

6. CITE YOUR SOURCES
   Every claim about need, prevalence, or effectiveness
   should have a citation (Author, Year)
```
