<objective>
Update 4 React variant skills to properly extend enhanced base skills.

Purpose: React variants should reference base skills and only add React-specific patterns, eliminating duplication.
Output: 4 updated React variant SKILL.md files with proper inheritance structure.

**Base skills to reference (enhanced in Phase 2):**
@skills/generic-code-reviewer/SKILL.md
@skills/generic-design-system/SKILL.md
@skills/generic-feature-developer/SKILL.md
@skills/generic-ux-designer/SKILL.md

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- Phase 2 established enhanced base skills with shared references pattern
- Variants should use "extends" pattern, not duplicate content
- Target ~100-150 lines per variant (stack-specific additions only)

**Pattern for variants:**
```markdown
# [Stack] [Type]

[Brief intro - 1-2 lines]

**Extends:** [generic-base-skill](../generic-base-skill/SKILL.md) - Read base skill first for full context.

## [Stack]-Specific Additions

[Only stack-specific content that differs from base]

- [Shared Standards] - Cross-cutting concerns

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update generic-react-code-reviewer</name>
  <files>skills/generic-react-code-reviewer/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite to extend base skill. Structure:
1. Keep YAML frontmatter (update description if needed)
2. Add "Extends: generic-code-reviewer" with link
3. REMOVE duplicated content (security, accessibility basics - these are in base)
4. KEEP React-specific: TypeScript strict mode, state management checks, component patterns, bundle size targets
5. KEEP React commands: npm run test, npm run type-check, etc.
6. Target ~80-100 lines (was 66, but thin - add value)

React-specific additions to include:
- Hook dependency arrays
- React Query/SWR patterns
- Zustand/Redux type safety
- Component memoization
- Lazy loading verification

  <name>Task 2: Update generic-react-design-system</name>
  <files>skills/generic-react-design-system/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite to extend base skill. Currently 307 lines (too long - duplicates base content). Structure:
1. Keep YAML frontmatter
2. Add "Extends: generic-design-system" with link
3. REMOVE duplicated content (color theory, spacing system basics, animation theory)
4. KEEP React-specific: Tailwind config patterns, CSS-in-JS, framer-motion, shadcn/ui patterns
5. KEEP JSX examples (component code snippets)
6. Target ~120-150 lines

React-specific additions to keep/enhance:
- Tailwind theme configuration
- CSS variable usage in React
- Framer motion patterns
- Component styling patterns (Button, Card, Modal JSX)
- Dark mode implementation (React context/hooks)

  <name>Task 3: Update generic-react-feature-developer</name>
  <files>skills/generic-react-feature-developer/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite to extend base skill. Currently 121 lines (reasonable but duplicates some base content). Structure:
1. Keep YAML frontmatter
2. Add "Extends: generic-feature-developer" with link
3. REMOVE duplicated content (general architecture patterns that are in base)
4. KEEP React-specific: Zustand patterns, IndexedDB usage, lazy loading, React Query
5. ADD value: Hook composition patterns, context vs store decisions
6. Target ~100-120 lines

React-specific additions to keep/enhance:
- Zustand store patterns with persist middleware
- IndexedDB integration for large data
- Lazy loading with Suspense
- Custom hook patterns (useFeature, useStore)
- React Query for server state
- Component composition patterns

Rewrite to extend base skill. Currently 278 lines (too long - duplicates UX principles). Structure:
1. Keep YAML frontmatter
2. Add "Extends: generic-ux-designer" with link
3. REMOVE duplicated content (design thinking, heuristics, psychology - all in base/shared)
4. KEEP React-specific: JSX interaction patterns, framer-motion micro-interactions, React accessibility hooks
5. Target ~100-130 lines

React-specific additions to keep/enhance:
- Framer motion animation patterns
- React accessibility patterns (focus management, ARIA in JSX)
- Optimistic UI patterns in React
- Skeleton loading components
- Form UX with React Hook Form
- Modal/dialog patterns with focus trapping

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] All 4 React variant files updated
- [ ] Each file has "Extends:" reference to base skill
- [ ] No duplicated content from base skills
- [ ] React-specific additions are valuable and clear
- [ ] Line counts in target range (80-150 lines each)
- [ ] "See Also" sections reference appropriate shared standards
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 4 React variant skills properly extend their base skills
- Total lines reduced (from ~772 to ~400-500)
- React-specific value preserved and enhanced
- Consistent structure across all 4 variants
</success_criteria>
