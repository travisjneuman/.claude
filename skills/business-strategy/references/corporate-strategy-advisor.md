### Cross-Scenario Analysis

#### What Strategies Win Across All Scenarios? (No-Regrets Moves)
1. [Strategy 1]: Works in scenarios [A, B, C, D] because [rationale]
   - Investment: [$X]
   - Priority: [Immediate execution]

2. [Strategy 2]: Works in scenarios [A, B, C, D] because [rationale]
   - Investment: [$X]
   - Priority: [Immediate execution]

**Recommendation:** Execute these immediately regardless of scenario.

---

#### What Strategies Are Scenario-Specific? (Options to Preserve)
1. [Strategy 1]: Only works in scenario [X]
   - Investment to preserve option: [$Y (small)]
   - Trigger: [When do we commit full investment]
   - Decision point: [Date or event]

2. [Strategy 2]: Only works in scenarios [X, Y]
   - Investment to preserve option: [$Y (small)]
   - Trigger: [When do we commit full investment]
   - Decision point: [Date or event]

**Recommendation:** Make small investments to preserve optionality, full commitment only when scenario clarity emerges.

### Early Warning Indicators (Signposts)

Track these metrics quarterly to identify which scenario is unfolding:

| Indicator | Data Source | Scenario A | Scenario B | Scenario C | Scenario D |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| [Metric 1] | [Source] | [Range] | [Range] | [Range] | [Range] |
| [Metric 2] | [Source] | [Range] | [Range] | [Range] | [Range] |
| [Metric 3] | [Source] | [Range] | [Range] | [Range] | [Range] |

**Review Cadence:** Quarterly scenario assessment, annual full scenario refresh

## Best Practices for Using These Frameworks

### Integration Across Frameworks
1. Start with **Porter's Five Forces** to understand industry structure
2. Use **SWOT** to assess your position within that structure
3. Apply **BCG Matrix** to manage portfolio of businesses
4. Deploy **Market Entry** framework for growth opportunities
5. Use **M&A** framework to evaluate build vs. buy
6. Apply **Scenario Planning** to stress-test strategies

### Frequency of Use
- **Porter's Five Forces:** Annually, or when major industry shifts occur
- **SWOT:** Quarterly for strategic reviews
- **BCG Matrix:** Annually for portfolio planning, quarterly monitoring
- **Market Entry:** As-needed for specific expansion opportunities
- **M&A:** For each potential acquisition
- **Scenario Planning:** Every 2-3 years, or when facing major uncertainty

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Analysis paralysis:** Set time limits, make decisions with imperfect information
2. **Confirmation bias:** Actively seek disconfirming evidence
3. **Overconfidence in projections:** Use ranges, probabilities, sensitivity analysis
4. **Ignoring implementation:** Strategy is worthless without execution
5. **Static thinking:** Markets change, refresh analysis regularly
6. **Consensus seeking:** Debate vigorously, decide clearly
7. **Ignoring opportunity cost:** Every strategy forecloses other options

### Executive Communication
When presenting strategic analysis to CEO/Board:
- **Lead with recommendation:** State your conclusion first
- **One-page summary:** Executive summary with key points
- **Data-driven:** Support every assertion with data
- **Clear alternatives:** Present 2-3 options with pros/cons
- **Risk-adjusted returns:** Use probability-weighted scenarios
- **Decision clarity:** What decision are you asking for?
- **Next steps:** Clear action plan with owners and dates
