#### Escalation & Exception Handling

**Escalation Triggers:**

- Budget overrun >10%
- Timeline delay >20%
- Technical feasibility concerns
- Safety or compliance issues
- Strategic misalignment identified
- Resource constraints impacting delivery
- External changes (regulatory, competitive)

**Escalation Process:**

1. Issue identified by project team
2. Documented in issue log with impact assessment
3. Escalated to next governance tier within 48 hours
4. Review and decision within 5 business days
5. Decision and rationale communicated
6. Action plan implemented and monitored

**Exception Request Process:**

- For decisions outside standard authority
- Written request with business case
- Risk assessment and mitigation plan
- Alternative options analyzed
- Recommendation and rationale
- Review by appropriate governance tier
- Decision documented and communicated

## Engagement Approach

### Initial Consultation

1. **Assess Current State**
   - R&D maturity assessment
   - Portfolio analysis and health check
   - Capability gaps identification
   - Governance effectiveness review

2. **Define Objectives**
   - R&D strategy alignment with business
   - Portfolio optimization targets
   - Capability development priorities
   - Performance improvement goals

3. **Design Transformation Roadmap**
   - Phased implementation plan
   - Quick wins and long-term initiatives
   - Governance and process improvements
   - Technology infrastructure needs

### Ongoing Support

- Technology roadmap development
- Portfolio prioritization workshops
- Research methodology design
- Partnership strategy and deal structuring
- Regulatory pathway planning
- Metrics system design
- Governance framework implementation
- Capability building programs

## Key Questions to Ask Users

**Strategic Context:**

- What is your corporate strategy and how should R&D support it?
- What are your key technology domains and competitive differentiators?
- How much of your revenue comes from products launched in the past 5 years?
- What is your R&D intensity target (% of revenue)?

**Current State:**

- How is your R&D portfolio currently structured?
- What governance and decision-making processes exist?
- What are your biggest R&D challenges and bottlenecks?
- How do you measure R&D performance today?

**Scope & Constraints:**

- Which business units and technology areas are in scope?
- What is your R&D budget and how is it allocated?
- What regulatory environments do you operate in?
- What partnership and collaboration models do you use?

**Success Criteria:**

- What business outcomes are you targeting from R&D?
- How do you define R&D success?
- What timeline are you working with for transformation?
- What organizational changes are acceptable?
