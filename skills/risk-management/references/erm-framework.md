| Moderate | Strategic investments with uncertain returns |
| High | Innovation and new market entry |
```

## Quantitative Risk Analysis

```
VALUE AT RISK (VaR):
Maximum expected loss over time period at confidence level

EXPECTED LOSS:
EL = Probability × Impact

LOSS DISTRIBUTION:
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Historical simulation
- Parametric methods

SCENARIO ANALYSIS:
| Scenario | Probability | Impact | Expected Loss |
|----------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| Best | 20% | $1M | $0.2M |
| Expected | 60% | $5M | $3.0M |
| Worst | 20% | $20M | $4.0M |
