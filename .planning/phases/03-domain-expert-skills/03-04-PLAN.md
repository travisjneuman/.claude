<objective>
Audit and enhance 6 technical/external domain skills: data-science, security, sales, marketing, sustainability-esg, rd-management.

Purpose: Ensure technical/external domain skills meet P0/P1/P2 quality standards and stay under 500-line threshold.
Output: 6 enhanced SKILL.md files with content split to references/ where needed.

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- P0/P1/P2 tiered structure prevents instruction overload (Phase 1)
- SKILL.md under 500 lines, split to references/ when approaching 400 (Phase 1)
- Task-focused descriptions for reliable activation (Research)

**Current skill sizes (audit targets):**
- data-science: 548 lines (OVER threshold - must split)
- security: 540 lines (OVER threshold - must split)
- sales: 504 lines (OVER threshold - must split)
- marketing: 455 lines (under threshold but close - may need trim)
- sustainability-esg: 494 lines (under threshold but close - may need trim)
- rd-management: 516 lines (OVER threshold - must split)

**Audit focus:**
- 4 skills over 500-line threshold - must split
- 2 skills close to threshold - optimize/trim
- Verify references/ folder exists for deep content
- Confirm 3+ frameworks present
- Task-focused descriptions

    Both skills over 500 threshold. For EACH skill:

    **data-science (548 lines):**
    1. Read SKILL.md, identify deep content for references/
    2. Create references/ folder if not exists
    3. Move detailed ML pipelines, comprehensive frameworks to references/
    4. Keep core patterns, decision trees, quick reference in SKILL.md
    5. Add explicit links to references/
    6. Target: under 400 lines

    **security (540 lines):**
    1. Read SKILL.md, identify deep content for references/
    2. Create references/ folder if not exists

    Both skills close to threshold (455 and 494 lines). For EACH skill:

    **marketing (455 lines):**
    1. Read SKILL.md, run P0 checklist
    2. Look for padding/filler that can be removed
    3. If still >400 after removing padding: Split to references/
    4. Verify description is task-focused
