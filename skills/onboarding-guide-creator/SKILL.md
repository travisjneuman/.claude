## Onboarding Anti-Patterns

```
COMMON ONBOARDING FAILURES:

1. INFORMATION FIREHOSE
   Problem: 8 hours of presentations on Day 1
   Fix: Spread learning over weeks; prioritize doing over watching

2. NO BUDDY OR MENTOR
   Problem: New hire has no safe person to ask "dumb" questions
   Fix: Assign buddy before start date; brief them on role

3. NO EARLY WIN
   Problem: New hire doesn't contribute anything meaningful for weeks
   Fix: Assign a small, completable task in Week 1

4. UNCLEAR EXPECTATIONS
   Problem: New hire doesn't know what success looks like
   Fix: Written 30/60/90 day goals shared on Day 1

5. MANAGER UNAVAILABLE
   Problem: Manager is traveling or overbooked during first week
   Fix: Block manager calendar; delay start date if necessary

6. TOOL ACCESS DELAYS
   Problem: Can't log in, can't code, can't sell — for days
   Fix: Provision all access before Day 1; have IT verify
