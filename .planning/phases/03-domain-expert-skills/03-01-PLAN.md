<objective>
Audit and enhance 4 business domain skills: business-strategy, operations, product-management, innovation.

Purpose: Ensure business domain skills meet P0/P1/P2 quality standards and stay under 500-line threshold.
Output: 4 enhanced SKILL.md files with content split to references/ where needed.

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- P0/P1/P2 tiered structure prevents instruction overload (Phase 1)
- SKILL.md under 500 lines, split to references/ when approaching 400 (Phase 1)
- Task-focused descriptions for reliable activation (Research)

**Current skill sizes (audit targets):**
- business-strategy: 325 lines (under threshold, good baseline)
- operations: 399 lines (under threshold, verify quality)
- product-management: 531 lines (OVER threshold - must split)
- innovation: 514 lines (OVER threshold - must split)

**Audit focus:**
- Not rebuilding - auditing and polishing
- Verify all have references/ folder for deep content
- Ensure SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Confirm 3+ frameworks present
- Task-focused descriptions

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Audit business-strategy (baseline skill)</name>
  <files>skills/business-strategy/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
    Read SKILL.md and run P0 checklist:
    1. Description is task-focused (lists capabilities, includes triggers)
    2. Under 500 lines (325 lines - passes)
    3. No padding/filler content
    4. 3+ recognized frameworks present
    5. Templates included or referenced

    Document audit results. This is the quality benchmark - note what makes it good.
    Make minimal enhancements if P0 gaps found. Do NOT expand if already good.

    Read SKILL.md (399 lines) and run P0 checklist:
    1. Description is task-focused
    2. Under 500 lines (passes at 399)
    3. No padding/filler content
    4. 3+ recognized frameworks present
    5. Templates actionable

    If P0 issues found: Fix minimally (don't add bulk).
    If approaching 400 lines with fixes needed: Consider references/ split.
    Document audit results with pass/fail for each P0 item.

  <files>skills/product-management/SKILL.md, skills/product-management/references/</files>
  <action>
    SKILL.md is 531 lines - OVER 500 threshold. Must split:

    1. Read full SKILL.md, identify deep content suitable for references/
    2. Create references/ folder if not exists
    3. Move detailed frameworks, long templates, comprehensive examples to references/
    4. Keep core patterns, decision trees, quick reference in SKILL.md
    5. Add explicit links: "See [Framework Details](./references/frameworks.md)"
    6. Target: SKILL.md under 400 lines, references/ contains deep content

    P0 checklist after split:
    - Description task-focused
    - Under 500 lines (target <400)
    - No padding
    - 3+ frameworks referenced
  </action>

    3. Move detailed methodologies, comprehensive templates to references/
    4. Keep core frameworks, decision criteria, quick reference in SKILL.md
    5. Add explicit reference links
    6. Target: SKILL.md under 400 lines
