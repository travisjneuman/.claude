# Glossary

Definitions of terms used throughout the Claude Code Toolkit.

**Last Updated:** February 2026 (v2.6.0)

## Core Components

### Agent

An autonomous Claude Code session spawned via the Task tool. Agents have their own context window, specified tools, and a designated model (haiku/sonnet/opus). They execute independently and return results. Defined in `~/.claude/agents/*.md`.

**Example:** The `debugging-specialist` agent is spawned to systematically investigate a bug through 4-phase analysis.

### Agent Team

An experimental feature where multiple Claude Code sessions collaborate via shared task lists and real-time messaging. Consists of a lead agent that coordinates teammates. Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`. See `docs/AGENT-TEAMS.md`.

### Auto-Claude

An autonomous multi-agent implementation system that creates an isolated git worktree, generates a spec, implements the feature, runs QA validation, and returns completed code. Invoked via `/auto-claude`. See `docs/AUTO-CLAUDE-GUIDE.md`.

### Command (Slash Command)

A user-invoked workflow defined as a markdown file in `~/.claude/commands/`. Typed as `/command-name` in Claude Code. Commands structure multi-step processes and can accept arguments.

**Example:** `/start-task Build a login form` triggers the intelligent task router.

### Context Window

The total amount of text Claude can process in a single session. The toolkit manages context by loading only relevant rules/skills, disabling unused MCP servers, and supporting `/compact` for context compression.

### GSD (Get Shit Done)

A multi-phase project management workflow system from the `get-shit-done` marketplace plugin. Provides commands like `/gsd:new-project`, `/gsd:progress`, `/gsd:plan-phase` for structured project execution. See `docs/GSD-TUTORIAL.md`.

### Hook

A bash script that runs automatically during Claude Code lifecycle events (SessionStart, Stop, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse). Configured in `settings.json`. Hooks automate tasks like pulling repos, formatting code, and blocking dangerous commands. Located in `~/.claude/hooks/`.

### Marketplace

A collection of 84 community-maintained GitHub repositories providing over 4,500+ additional skills, agents, and commands. Located in `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/`. Configured as read-only (fetch-only, push blocked).

### MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)

External server processes that extend Claude Code's tool capabilities. Examples: sequential-thinking for structured reasoning, playwright for browser automation, memory for persistent storage. Configured in `~/.claude/.mcp.json`, toggled via `/mcp`. All disabled by default to save context tokens.

### Plugin

A distributable package that can contain commands, agents, skills, and hooks. Plugins are installed from GitHub or local paths and registered in `settings.json` under `enabledPlugins`.

**Local plugins:** `~/.claude/plugins/local/`
**Marketplace plugins:** `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/`

### Rule

A contextual guidance document in `~/.claude/rules/` that loads on-demand based on prompt keywords. Rules provide checklists, technology patterns, workflow methodology, and tooling guidance. They don't execute autonomously — they inform Claude's approach.

**Categories:** checklists, workflows, stacks, tooling.

### Skill

A domain knowledge package in `~/.claude/skills/` containing a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter. Skills auto-activate based on conversation context or can be explicitly invoked. They provide guidelines, patterns, and checklists but don't execute autonomously.

**Example:** `generic-code-reviewer` activates when discussing PR reviews, providing a structured review process.

### Subagent

An agent spawned via the Task tool that runs in its own context window and returns results to the caller. This is the non-team form of delegation — one-way communication, lower token cost than Agent Teams.

### Template

A starter file in `~/.claude/templates/` for creating new toolkit components (skills, agents, commands, plugins, project CLAUDE.md files, task plans). Used via copy-and-modify.

---

## Configuration Terms

### Auto-Routing

The keyword-matching system defined in CLAUDE.md that automatically loads relevant rules and skills based on prompt content. No slash commands needed — Claude detects context and loads the right resources.

### Counts (counts.json)

A JSON file at `~/.claude/counts.json` containing the source-of-truth counts for skills, agents, repos, commands, and marketplace skills. Generated by `scripts/update-counts.sh` and used by the website.

### Frontmatter

YAML metadata at the top of markdown files, delimited by `---`. Used by skills (name, description), docs (name, description, category), and commands (description, arguments) for parsing and display.

```yaml

```

### Gitlink

A git mechanism for tracking nested repositories. Marketplace repos in `plugins/marketplaces/` are managed as gitlinks — the parent repo tracks the commit hash but not the contents.

### No-Push

A safety configuration where a git remote's push URL is set to `no_push`, preventing accidental writes to upstream repositories. Applied to all marketplace repos.

---

## Workflow Terms

### Complexity Score

A rating (0-5+) assigned by `/start-task` to determine which workflow to use. Based on factors like multiple components, unknown codebase areas, architecture decisions, and external integrations.

| Score | Route                    |
| ----- | ------------------------ |
| <= 0  | Direct execution         |
| 1-2   | Plan mode                |
| 3-4   | Auto-Claude or plan mode |
| >= 5  | GSD multi-phase project  |

### Domain Routing

The system by which `/start-task` detects the domain of a task (frontend, backend, data science, etc.) and loads the appropriate skills, agents, and rules.

### Plan Mode

A workflow state (entered via EnterPlanMode) where Claude explores the codebase and designs an implementation approach before writing code. The plan is presented for user approval before execution begins.

### Session Handoff

The process of preserving context between Claude Code sessions. The `session-stop-summary.sh` hook writes `last-session.md`, and `session-start-context.sh` loads it if the previous session was within 24 hours.

### Verification Template

A checklist (`rules/checklists/verification-template.md`) used after completing any task to verify success. Covers code quality, constraint compliance, integration, and solution robustness.

## Infrastructure Terms

### Cloudflare Pages

The hosting platform for the showcase website. Auto-deploys from the GitHub repository on push. No manual deployment needed.

### Pull-All-Repos Script

`~/.claude/_pull-all-repos.sh` — fetches updates for the parent repo and all 84 marketplace repos, fixes detached HEAD states, enforces no-push on marketplace repos, and updates documentation counts.

### Update-Counts Script

`~/.claude/scripts/update-counts.sh` — scans the filesystem for actual skill/agent/repo/command counts and updates all hardcoded references in README.md, counts.json, plugin.json, MASTER_INDEX.md, and other files.

_Terms are defined in the context of this toolkit. Some terms (like "agent" and "skill") have broader meanings in AI/ML — here they refer specifically to Claude Code Toolkit components._
