# Content Repurposer

Frameworks for systematically transforming content across formats, platforms, and audiences while maintaining message integrity and maximizing reach.

## Content Transformation Matrix

### Platform-Specific Formats

| Source Format | Twitter/X | LinkedIn | Instagram | Newsletter | Blog | Podcast Notes |
|--------------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|------|--------------|
| **Blog post** | Thread (5-10 tweets) | Article excerpt + CTA | Carousel (5-10 slides) | Summary + link | N/A | Episode outline |
| **Research report** | Key stat tweets | Executive summary | Infographic | Top findings | Summary article | Discussion points |
| **Presentation** | Quote cards | Slide highlights | Carousel | Key takeaways | Written recap | Interview format |
| **Video/Webinar** | Clip highlights | Key moments + transcript | Reels/clips | Timestamps + summary | Full transcript post | Audio extract |
| **Case study** | Results thread | Before/after story | Testimonial graphic | Customer spotlight | Full narrative | Interview episode |
| **Data/Report** | Single stat graphics | Analysis + chart | Data visualization | Trend commentary | Deep dive analysis | Data storytelling |

### Transformation Workflow

```
CONTENT REPURPOSING PIPELINE:

1. AUDIT SOURCE CONTENT
   - Identify core message (1 sentence)
   - Extract key data points (3-5 stats)
   - List supporting arguments (3-5 points)
   - Note quotable phrases
   - Identify visual elements

2. MAP TARGET PLATFORMS
   For each platform, define:
   - Format constraints (character limits, dimensions)
   - Audience expectations (tone, depth, style)
   - Best posting times
   - CTA appropriate for platform
   - Hashtag/keyword strategy

3. TRANSFORM CONTENT
   - Adapt tone to platform voice
   - Restructure for format requirements
   - Add platform-native elements (polls, carousels, threads)
   - Optimize headlines/hooks for each platform
   - Create platform-specific CTAs

4. SCHEDULE AND DISTRIBUTE
   - Stagger releases (don't post everywhere simultaneously)
   - Primary platform first, then secondary
   - Monitor performance per platform
   - Iterate based on engagement data
```

## Format-Specific Templates

### Blog to Twitter/X Thread

```
THREAD TEMPLATE (from blog post):

Tweet 1 (HOOK):
  [Surprising stat or bold claim from the article]

  A thread on [topic]. 🧵

Tweet 2-8 (BODY):
  Each tweet = one key point from the blog
  - Lead with the insight, not the setup
  - Use numbers and specifics
  - One idea per tweet
  - End tweets with transitions or line breaks

Tweet 9 (SUMMARY):
  TL;DR:
  • [Point 1]
  • [Point 2]
  • [Point 3]

Tweet 10 (CTA):
  Full article with [additional value]: [link]

  If this was useful, follow for more on [topic].

THREAD RULES:
  - Hook must stand alone (most people see only tweet 1)
  - Each tweet should be valuable independently
  - 5-12 tweets ideal (shorter = better engagement)
  - Include 1-2 data points per tweet maximum
  - End with clear CTA (follow, link, retweet)
```

### Blog to LinkedIn Post

```
LINKEDIN POST TEMPLATE:

[Hook line — bold claim, question, or surprising stat]

[2-3 sentence expansion of the hook]

Here's what I learned:

1. [Key insight] — [1 sentence explanation]
2. [Key insight] — [1 sentence explanation]
3. [Key insight] — [1 sentence explanation]

[Personal reflection or lesson — 1-2 sentences]

[CTA: What do you think? Link in comments. etc.]

---

LINKEDIN RULES:
  - First 2 lines must hook (before "see more" fold)
  - 1,300 characters is the sweet spot
  - Personal voice outperforms corporate voice
  - Ask a question to drive comments
  - Put links in first comment (algorithm preference)
  - Use line breaks liberally for readability
```

### Blog to Instagram Carousel

```
CAROUSEL TEMPLATE (10 slides max):

Slide 1 (COVER):
  - Bold headline (5-8 words)
  - Subtitle with value proposition
  - Clean design, brand colors
  - "Swipe →" indicator

Slides 2-8 (CONTENT):
  - One point per slide
  - Large text (readable without zooming)
  - Supporting graphic or icon
  - Consistent design template
  - Max 30 words per slide

Slide 9 (SUMMARY):

  - 3-4 bullet points
  - Condensed version of all slides

Slide 10 (CTA):
  - "Save this for later"
  - "Share with someone who needs this"
  - "Follow @handle for more"
  - Link to full article in bio

CAROUSEL RULES:
  - Square (1080x1080) or Portrait (1080x1350)
  - Consistent font and color scheme
  - Each slide must work independently
  - Text-heavy slides outperform image-heavy
  - Cover slide is everything (determines swipe rate)
```

### Long-Form to Newsletter

```
NEWSLETTER TRANSFORMATION:

SUBJECT LINE: [Curiosity gap or benefit statement]
PREVIEW TEXT: [Extends subject line, doesn't repeat it]

OPENING (2-3 sentences):
  - Personal hook or timely reference

KEY POINTS (3-5):
  Each point:
  - Bold subheading
  - 2-3 sentence explanation
  - Data point or example
  - "Why it matters" sentence

ACTIONABLE TAKEAWAY:
  - "Here's what to do with this:"
  - 1-3 specific actions reader can take today

CTA:
  - Link to full content
  - Reply prompt ("What's your take?")
  - Share prompt

NEWSLETTER RULES:

```

## Tone Adaptation Guide

### Tone Shifting Framework

| Dimension | Formal | Professional | Conversational | Casual |
|-----------|--------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **Contractions** | Never | Occasionally | Frequently | Always |
| **Jargon** | Industry-standard | Defined on first use | Avoided | Slang OK |
| **Sentences** | Complex, long | Mixed length | Short, punchy | Fragments OK |
| **Pronouns** | Third person | "We" / "You" | "I" / "You" | "I" / "You" |
| **Humor** | None | Light, professional | Moderate | Frequent |
| **Data** | Citations required | Data-supported | Anecdotal OK | Opinions welcome |
| **CTA** | "Please review" | "Consider implementing" | "Try this today" | "Go do this!" |

### Platform-Native Voice

```
PLATFORM VOICE GUIDE:

TWITTER/X:
  - Sharp, witty, concise
  - Hot takes and strong opinions
  - Numbers and lists
  - "One thing" framing
  - Contrarian positioning works

LINKEDIN:
  - Professional but personal
  - "Lessons learned" framing
  - Story-driven (personal anecdote → business insight)
  - Humble bragging is expected
  - Engagement bait: questions, polls, hot takes

INSTAGRAM:
  - Visual-first, text supports
  - Aspirational and educational
  - Step-by-step formats
  - "Save-worthy" content
  - Emoji use is normal and expected

NEWSLETTER:
  - Intimate, one-to-one voice
  - Longer form, deeper analysis
  - Personal stories and behind-the-scenes
  - Exclusive feel ("you're getting this first")
  - Reader relationship building

BLOG:
  - Comprehensive, authoritative
  - SEO-aware (keywords in headings)
  - Structured with scannable headings
  - Internal and external links
  - Evergreen value
```

## Content Atomization Strategy

### One Piece → Many Assets

```
FROM ONE BLOG POST, CREATE:

SOCIAL (same week):
  □ Twitter/X thread (5-10 tweets)
  □ LinkedIn post (condensed insights)
  □ Instagram carousel (visual summary)
  □ Facebook post (discussion prompt)

VISUAL (within 2 weeks):
  □ Infographic (key data points)
  □ Quote cards (2-3 quotable lines)
  □ Chart/graph (standalone data viz)

AUDIO/VIDEO (within 1 month):
  □ Podcast episode outline
  □ Short-form video script (60-90 sec)
  □ Webinar talking points

DERIVATIVE CONTENT (ongoing):
  □ Newsletter feature
  □ Email sequence content
  □ Presentation slide
  □ Internal training material
  □ FAQ entry
```

### Headline Adaptation

| Platform | Headline Style | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Blog** | SEO + clarity | "How to Reduce Customer Churn by 30% Using Data Analytics" |
| **Twitter** | Hook + curiosity | "We cut churn by 30%. Here's the counterintuitive thing that worked:" |
| **LinkedIn** | Personal + lesson | "I spent 6 months obsessing over churn. The answer was simpler than I thought." |
| **Instagram** | Short + visual | "30% Less Churn (swipe for how)" |
| **Newsletter** | Benefit + urgency | "The churn-reduction playbook we wish we had 2 years ago" |
| **YouTube** | Curiosity + keyword | "We Reduced Churn by 30% — The Strategy Nobody Talks About" |
