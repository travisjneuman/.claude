### Year-in-Numbers Page Design

```
YEAR IN NUMBERS LAYOUT:

[Large number]    [Icon]    [Label]
12,500            [people]  People Served

[Large number]    [Icon]    [Label]
94%               [chart]   Satisfaction Rate

[Large number]    [Icon]    [Label]
$2.3M             [dollar]  Programs Delivered

[Large number]    [Icon]    [Label]
85%               [arrow]   Showed Improvement

[Large number]    [Icon]    [Label]
47                [map pin] Communities Reached

[Large number]    [Icon]    [Label]
1,200             [hands]   Volunteer Hours

DESIGN RULES:
  - Maximum 8 metrics on one page
  - Use the largest, most impressive numbers
  - Round to clean numbers (12,500 not 12,487)
  - Include one comparison ("up 23% from last year")
  - Use consistent icon style
  - White space between metrics
```

## Data Visualization Guidelines

### Chart Selection Guide

| Data Type | Recommended Chart | When to Use |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Part of whole** | Pie or donut chart | Revenue by source, expense breakdown |
| **Comparison** | Bar chart (horizontal) | Program outcomes side by side |
| **Change over time** | Line chart | Multi-year trend data |
| **Before/after** | Paired bar chart | Pre-post program comparison |
| **Geographic** | Map with color coding | Where programs operate |
| **Single metric** | Large callout number | Year-in-numbers hero stats |
| **Progress** | Progress bar or gauge | Goal completion percentage |
| **Ranking** | Horizontal bar (sorted) | Top programs by outcome |

### Visualization Best Practices

```
DATA VIZ RULES FOR IMPACT REPORTS:

DO:
  ✓ Start bar charts at zero
  ✓ Label data points directly (avoid legends when possible)
  ✓ Use organization's brand colors
  ✓ Include data source and date
  ✓ Round numbers for readability
  ✓ Use consistent scales across similar charts
  ✓ Make charts accessible (alt text, patterns not just color)

DON'T:
  ✗ Use 3D charts (distorts perception)
  ✗ Use more than 5-6 colors in one chart
  ✗ Include raw data tables (summarize visually)
  ✗ Use pie charts with more than 5 slices
  ✗ Truncate axes to exaggerate change
  ✗ Present data without context or comparison
```

## Storytelling Framework

### Beneficiary Story Template

```
IMPACT STORY TEMPLATE:

TITLE: [Compelling, human-centered headline]

  [How their life is different now]
  [Forward-looking statement about their future]

PULL QUOTE:
  "[Powerful direct quote that captures the transformation]"

ETHICAL STORYTELLING CHECKLIST:
  [ ] Informed written consent obtained
  [ ] Story reviewed and approved by subject
  [ ] Subject chose how to be identified (name, photo)
  [ ] Story preserves dignity and agency
