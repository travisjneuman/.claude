# Project State

## Project Summary

**Building:** Transform Claude Code skills library from basic guidelines into expert-level knowledge systems

**Core requirements:**
- Skills auto-activate on natural language
- Guidance feels expert-level (matches seasoned professionals)
- Token efficiency maintained (lean SKILL.md + deep references/)
- All ~40 skills brought to consistent quality
- Descriptions are task-focused, not qualifier-focused

**Constraints:**
- Token efficiency: Core SKILL.md under 500 lines (~5-10KB)
- Backward compatibility: Existing activation still works
- Research-backed: Based on recognized best practices
- Self-contained: Skills work without external dependencies

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 6 (Domain Expert Skills)
Plan: 2 of 4 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2025-12-17 - Completed 03-02-PLAN.md

Progress: ████████░░ 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 8
- Average duration: 2.2 min
- Total execution time: 0.33 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 2 | 10 min | 5 min |
| 2. Base Generic Skills | 4 | 6 min | 1.5 min |
| 3. Domain Expert Skills | 2 | 4 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 4 min, 2 min, 1 min, 1.5 min, 1.5 min
- Trend: Fast execution

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 0 | Base skills first | 3-4x multiplier effect on stack variants |
| 0 | Group domain skills by affinity | Efficient batch processing (4 skills per plan) |
| 0 | Research pre-completed | Stack/implementation/risks research done upfront |
| 1-01 | Three distinct templates by skill type | Domain/code/utility have fundamentally different structures |
| 1-01 | P0/P1/P2 tiered checklist | Prevents instruction overload (research: >10 = 19% drop) |
| 1-02 | Lean shared standards (<150 lines each) | Token efficiency when referenced by multiple skills |
