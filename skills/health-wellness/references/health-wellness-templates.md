### Manager Script: Compassionate Mental Health Conversation

**When to Use**: When you notice an employee showing signs of distress (performance changes, withdrawal, visible stress)

**Opening**:
"[Employee name], I wanted to check in with you. I've noticed [specific observation: you've seemed quieter lately / you've missed a few deadlines, which isn't like you / you mentioned feeling overwhelmed]. I care about you, and I want to make sure you're doing okay. How are you feeling?"

**Listen Actively**:

- Let them share without interruption
- Show empathy: "That sounds really difficult" or "I can understand why that would be stressful"
- Avoid minimizing: Don't say "It's not that bad" or "Just stay positive"

**Offer Support**:
"I want you to know that [Company] has resources to support you. Have you heard about our Employee Assistance Program? It's completely confidential—I won't know if you use it or what you talk about. They offer free counseling, and many people find it really helpful."

"If work is contributing to your stress, let's talk about what adjustments we can make. Would it help to [shift some deadlines / adjust your workload / work from home more often]?"

**Follow-Up**:
"I'm going to send you the EAP contact information. There's no pressure to use it, but it's there if you want it. Let's check in again next week—how does [day/time] work?"

**What NOT to Say**:

- "I know exactly how you feel" (you don't)
- "Have you tried just exercising more?" (oversimplifies)
- "Other people have it worse" (invalidates their experience)
- "Let me know if you need anything" (too vague; offer specific support)

**Escalation**:
If the employee mentions self-harm, suicide, or you're seriously concerned about their safety:

1. Stay calm and take them seriously
2. Ask directly: "Are you thinking about hurting yourself?"
3. Do not leave them alone if at imminent risk
4. Contact EAP crisis line immediately: [Phone]
5. Involve HR if needed for safety planning

**Documentation**:

- Note the conversation date and general topic (e.g., "Discussed workload stress and EAP resources")
- Do NOT document mental health details or diagnoses
- Focus on performance and accommodations, not health conditions
