Comprehensive strategic planning frameworks for competitive analysis, growth strategy, and decision-making.

## Core Strategy Frameworks

### Porter's Five Forces Analysis

Analyze industry competitiveness:

| Force                      | Key Questions                                             | Analysis Focus                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Threat of New Entrants** | Capital requirements? Regulatory barriers? Brand loyalty? | Entry barriers, scale advantages    |
| **Supplier Power**         | Concentration? Switching costs? Forward integration risk? | Input cost control, supply security |
| **Buyer Power**            | Concentration? Price sensitivity? Backward integration?   | Customer bargaining leverage        |
| **Threat of Substitutes**  | Alternative solutions? Price-performance tradeoffs?       | Disruption vulnerability            |
| **Competitive Rivalry**    | Industry growth? Differentiation? Exit barriers?          | Competitive intensity               |

### BCG Growth-Share Matrix

Portfolio analysis for resource allocation:

| Quadrant           | Definition              | Strategy                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Stars**          | High growth, high share | Invest heavily, defend position |
| **Cash Cows**      | Low growth, high share  | Harvest, fund other initiatives |
| **Question Marks** | High growth, low share  | Invest selectively or divest    |
| **Dogs**           | Low growth, low share   | Divest or minimize investment   |

### McKinsey 9-Box Matrix

More nuanced portfolio positioning:

```
                    INDUSTRY ATTRACTIVENESS
                    High      Medium    Low
            High    Invest    Invest    Protect
BUSINESS    Med     Invest    Selective Harvest
STRENGTH    Low     Selective Harvest   Divest
```

### SWOT Analysis (Strategic)

Beyond basic SWOT - strategic implications:

```
INTERNAL FACTORS:
Strengths → Leverage for competitive advantage
Weaknesses → Address or neutralize

EXTERNAL FACTORS:
Opportunities → Capture with existing strengths
Threats → Mitigate through strategic moves

STRATEGIC QUESTIONS:
1. S-O: How can strengths exploit opportunities?
2. W-O: Which weaknesses prevent capturing opportunities?
3. S-T: Which strengths can counter threats?
4. W-T: Which weaknesses make us vulnerable to threats?
```

## Competitive Strategy

### Generic Competitive Strategies (Porter)

| Strategy            | Focus                    | Key Success Factors                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Cost Leadership** | Lowest cost producer     | Scale, efficiency, tight cost control |
| **Differentiation** | Unique value proposition | Innovation, brand, quality            |
| **Focus (Cost)**    | Cost leader in niche     | Specialized efficiency                |
| **Focus (Diff)**    | Differentiated in niche  | Deep customer understanding           |

### Blue Ocean Strategy

Create uncontested market space:

| Red Ocean                  | Blue Ocean                    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Compete in existing market | Create new market space       |
| Beat the competition       | Make competition irrelevant   |
| Exploit existing demand    | Create and capture new demand |
| Value-cost tradeoff        | Break value-cost tradeoff     |

**Four Actions Framework:**

- **Eliminate:** Which factors should be eliminated?

- **Create:** Which factors should be created that industry never offered?
