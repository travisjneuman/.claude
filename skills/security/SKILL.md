# Information Security Expert

Comprehensive security frameworks for cybersecurity, incident response, and security architecture.

## Security Architecture

### Zero Trust Architecture

```
ZERO TRUST PRINCIPLES:
- Never trust, always verify
- Assume breach
- Verify explicitly
- Least privilege access
- Micro-segmentation

ZERO TRUST COMPONENTS:

IDENTITY:
- Strong authentication (MFA)
- Identity governance
- Privileged access management
- Continuous validation

DEVICES:
- Device health verification
- Endpoint detection and response
- Mobile device management
- Asset inventory

NETWORK:
- Micro-segmentation
- Software-defined perimeter
- Encrypted communications
- Network access control

APPLICATIONS:
- Application-level authentication
- API security
- Web application firewall
- Secure coding practices

DATA:
- Data classification
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Data loss prevention
- Access controls
```

### Defense in Depth

```
SECURITY LAYERS:

PHYSICAL:
- Data center security
- Badge access
- Surveillance
- Environmental controls

PERIMETER:
- Firewalls
- IDS/IPS
- DMZ
- VPN

NETWORK:
- Segmentation
- Encryption
- Network monitoring
- NAC

HOST:
- Endpoint protection
- Host-based firewall
- Hardening
- Patch management

APPLICATION:
- WAF
- Secure coding
- Input validation
- Authentication

DATA:
- Encryption
- DLP
- Access controls
- Backup/recovery
```

### Cloud Security

| Domain | Controls |
|--------|----------|
| **Identity** | SSO, MFA, PAM, IAM policies |
| **Compute** | Hardened images, container security |
| **Network** | VPC, security groups, WAF |
| **Storage** | Encryption, access policies, backup |
| **Logging** | CloudTrail, SIEM integration |
| **Compliance** | Config rules, automated remediation |

For detailed security frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001, CIS Controls, MITRE ATT&CK), see [Security Frameworks Reference](references/security-frameworks.md).

## Vulnerability Management

### Vulnerability Management Process

```
LIFECYCLE:

1. DISCOVERY
   - Asset inventory
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Penetration testing
   - Code analysis

2. PRIORITIZATION
   - CVSS scoring
   - Asset criticality
   - Exploit availability
   - Business context

3. REMEDIATION
   - Patch management
   - Configuration changes
   - Compensating controls
   - Risk acceptance

4. VERIFICATION
   - Rescan
   - Validation testing
   - Documentation
   - Reporting

5. REPORTING
   - Executive dashboards
   - Trend analysis
   - Compliance reporting
   - SLA tracking
```

### CVSS Scoring

| Score | Severity | SLA Target |
|-------|----------|------------|
| 9.0-10.0 | Critical | 7 days |
| 7.0-8.9 | High | 30 days |
| 4.0-6.9 | Medium | 90 days |
| 0.1-3.9 | Low | Best effort |

### Patch Management

```
PATCH PROCESS:

1. IDENTIFICATION
   - Vendor announcements
   - Vulnerability feeds
   - Security bulletins

2. ASSESSMENT
   - Applicability
   - Risk evaluation
   - Test requirements

3. TESTING
   - Lab validation
   - Compatibility testing
   - Rollback planning

4. DEPLOYMENT
   - Pilot group
   - Phased rollout
   - Monitoring

5. VERIFICATION
   - Confirm installation
   - Functional testing
   - Documentation
```

## Identity & Access Management

### IAM Framework

```
IAM COMPONENTS:

IDENTITY LIFECYCLE:
- Provisioning
- Modification
- De-provisioning
- Certification

AUTHENTICATION:
- Password policies
- Multi-factor authentication
- Single sign-on
- Passwordless

AUTHORIZATION:
- Role-based access (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access (ABAC)
- Least privilege
- Separation of duties

GOVERNANCE:
- Access reviews
- Policy enforcement
- Audit logging
- Compliance reporting
```

### Privileged Access Management

```
PAM CONTROLS:

VAULT:
- Credential storage
- Password rotation
- Secrets management

SESSION:
- Session recording
- Just-in-time access
- Time-limited credentials

MONITORING:
- Activity logging
- Behavioral analytics
- Alert on anomalies

GOVERNANCE:
- Access certification
- Policy enforcement
- Compliance reporting
```

## Security Awareness

### Security Training Program

| Topic | Frequency | Audience |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **New Hire Security** | Onboarding | All employees |
| **Annual Refresh** | Annually | All employees |
| **Phishing Awareness** | Quarterly | All employees |
| **Developer Security** | Annually | Development team |
| **Executive Briefings** | Quarterly | Leadership |
| **Role-Based** | As needed | Specific roles |

### Phishing Simulation

```
SIMULATION PROGRAM:

FREQUENCY: Monthly

DIFFICULTY LEVELS:
- Easy: Generic, obvious errors
- Medium: Branded, some personalization
- Hard: Targeted, well-crafted

METRICS:
- Click rate
- Report rate
- Training completion
- Trend over time

RESPONSE:
- Click → Immediate training
- Report → Positive reinforcement
- Repeat offenders → Additional training
```

## Security Metrics

### Key Security Metrics

| Category | Metric | Target |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Vulnerability** | Critical vulns open >30 days | 0 |
| **Patching** | Systems patched within SLA | 95%+ |
| **Incidents** | Mean time to detect | <24 hours |
| **Access** | Orphan accounts | 0 |
| **Training** | Completion rate | 95%+ |
