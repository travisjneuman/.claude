### 2. IP Monetization Strategies

#### Licensing Models

**Model 1: Exclusive License**
- **Structure**: Single licensee, specific field or geography
- **Royalty**: Premium rates (5-20%+ of sales)
- **Duration**: Life of patent or term
- **Use Cases**: Blockbuster inventions, specialized applications
- **Example**: Biotech drug license to pharma company

**Model 2: Non-Exclusive License**
- **Structure**: Multiple licensees
- **Royalty**: Lower rates (1-5% of sales)
- **Duration**: Term or perpetual
- **Use Cases**: Standard technologies, broad applications
- **Example**: Codec licenses for consumer electronics

**Model 3: Cross-License**
- **Structure**: Bilateral patent exchange
- **Royalty**: Net royalty payment or royalty-free
- **Duration**: Typically perpetual
- **Use Cases**: Complex products with multiple patent holders
- **Example**: Smartphone companies cross-licensing patent portfolios

**Model 4: Patent Pool**
- **Structure**: Multiple patent owners contribute to pool
- **Royalty**: Shared royalties among contributors
- **Duration**: Pool term
- **Use Cases**: Industry standards, complementary patents
- **Example**: MPEG video compression patents

**Model 5: Patent Sale/Divestiture**
- **Structure**: Outright sale of patent rights
- **Payment**: One-time payment or earnouts
- **Use Cases**: Non-core patents, portfolio pruning, liquidity events
- **Example**: Legacy patent portfolio sale to NPE or competitor

#### Royalty Rate Determination

**Top-Down Approach:**
- Industry standard royalty rates (benchmarking)
- Rule of thumb: 25% of incremental profit attributable to patent
- Adjust for factors: exclusivity, geography, field of use, competition

**Bottom-Up Approach:**
- Calculate incremental value from patented technology
- Determine profit margin improvement or cost savings
- Split value between licensor and licensee (typically 25-50% to licensor)

**Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP):**
- Score patent on multiple factors (technology, market, legal)
- Weight factors by importance
- Compare to benchmark royalty rates
- Adjust based on composite score

**Georgia-Pacific Factors (15 factors for reasonable royalty):**
1. Royalties received by patentee for licensing the patent in suit
2. Rates paid by licensee for use of comparable patents
3. Nature and scope of license (exclusive vs. non-exclusive)
4. Licensor's established policy and marketing program
5. Commercial relationship between licensor and licensee
6. Derivative or convoyed sales
7. Duration of patent and license term
8. Established profitability and commercial success
9. Utility and advantages over old modes
10. Nature of patented invention and benefits to users
11. Extent of use and value to infringer
12. Portion of profit or selling price customary in field
13. Portion of realizable profit attributable to invention vs. improvements
14. Expert testimony
15. Hypothetical negotiation outcome (willing licensor/licensee)

**Royalty Structure Options:**

**Running Royalty:**
- % of net sales revenue
- Common: 1-10% depending on industry and value
- Advantages: Aligns incentives, shares risk
- Disadvantages: Audit requirements, administrative overhead

**Lump Sum / Paid-Up License:**
- One-time payment for perpetual rights
- Calculation: NPV of expected running royalties
- Advantages: No ongoing administration, certainty
- Disadvantages: Risk of overpayment/underpayment

**Hybrid Model:**
- Upfront payment + running royalty
- Milestone payments based on development/sales achievements
- Minimum annual royalty guarantees
- Advantages: Balances risk, ensures commitment

**Reach-Through Royalty:**
