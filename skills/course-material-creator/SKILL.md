## Reading List Curation

### Reading Selection Framework

```
READING LIST CURATION:

FOR EACH READING, EVALUATE:
  Relevance:     Does it directly support learning objectives?
  Accessibility: Is the reading level appropriate?
  Recency:       Is the information current? (or intentionally historical?)
  Diversity:     Does the list include varied perspectives?
  Length:         Is the total reading load reasonable?

READING LOAD GUIDELINES:
  Undergraduate:  30-50 pages/week
  Graduate:       50-100 pages/week
  Professional:   20-40 pages/week (busy professionals)
  Self-directed:  Learner's pace (provide suggested schedule)

CATEGORIZATION:
  Required:    Must read before class/session
  Recommended: Deepens understanding of required material
  Reference:   Available for future use/specific needs
  Optional:    For highly interested learners
```

### Annotated Reading List Template

```
READING LIST: [Course Name]

WEEK 1: [Topic]
  REQUIRED:
  - [Author]. "[Title]." [Source], [Year]. [Pages/sections].

### Course-Level Alignment

```
CURRICULUM MAP:

Program Objective    | Course(s)           | Assessment           | Bloom's Level
---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------
[Program obj 1]      | [Course A, Week 3]  | [Assignment type]    | Apply
                     | [Course B, Week 7]  | [Project component]  | Create

```

### Backward Design Process

```
BACKWARD DESIGN (Understanding by Design):

STAGE 1: DESIRED RESULTS
  What should students know and be able to do?
  - Enduring understandings (big ideas that last)
  - Essential questions (driving inquiry)
  - Learning objectives (specific, measurable)

STAGE 2: ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE
  How will you know students have learned?
  - Performance tasks (authentic assessment)
  - Other evidence (quizzes, observations, self-assessment)
  - Criteria for success (rubrics, checklists)

STAGE 3: LEARNING PLAN
  What experiences will enable learning?
  - Instructional activities (lessons, labs, discussions)
  - Sequence and pacing (build from simple to complex)
  - Resources and materials (readings, tools, examples)
  - Differentiation (support and extension)
```
