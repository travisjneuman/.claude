# R&D Management Expert

Comprehensive R&D frameworks for research strategy, technology roadmapping, and innovation pipeline management.

## R&D Strategy

### R&D Portfolio Framework

```
PORTFOLIO DIMENSIONS:

BY TYPE:
- Basic Research (10-20%)
- Applied Research (20-30%)
- Development (50-70%)

BY TIME HORIZON:
- Near-term (<2 years)
- Mid-term (2-5 years)
- Long-term (>5 years)

BY RISK:
- Core (incremental)
- Adjacent (new territory)
- Breakthrough (transformational)

PORTFOLIO BALANCE:
Mature companies: More development, less research
Growth companies: More research, balanced development
Disruption risk: More breakthrough investment
```

### R&D Investment Analysis
