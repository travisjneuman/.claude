## Quality Checklist

### Pre-Submission Review

| Check | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Executive summary is standalone (readable without full memo) | [ ] |
| Investment thesis has 3-5 clear, testable pillars | [ ] |
| TAM methodology is bottoms-up (not just top-down) | [ ] |
| Financial projections have bear/base/bull scenarios | [ ] |
| Risks section is honest (not just pro-forma) | [ ] |
| Recommendation is clear and unambiguous | [ ] |
| Sources cited for market data and claims | [ ] |
| Valuation methodology is appropriate for stage | [ ] |
| Cap table impact is modeled | [ ] |
| Management references completed (min 3-5) | [ ] |

### Common Pitfalls

```
AVOID THESE MEMO FAILURES:

1. THESIS WITHOUT EVIDENCE
   Bad:  "Large TAM with strong tailwinds"
   Good: "TAM of $12B growing 18% CAGR per Gartner 2025, driven by
          regulatory mandate effective 2026 (cite: HB-1234)"

2. HOCKEY STICK WITHOUT DRIVERS
   Bad:  Revenue 5x in 3 years
   Good: Revenue 5x driven by: 2x ASP increase (upsell to enterprise),
         1.5x customer growth (new sales hires), 1.7x NRR (product expansion)

3. RISKS WITHOUT MITIGANTS
   Bad:  "Key person risk on founder"
   Good: "Key person risk mitigated by: strong VP Engineering hired Q3,
          documented processes, board-approved succession plan"

4. VALUATION WITHOUT CONTEXT
   Bad:  "12x ARR is fair"
   Good: "12x ARR represents 20% discount to median comp (15x) justified
          by smaller scale but offset by 2x higher growth rate"
```

## Memo Formatting Guidelines

```
FORMATTING STANDARDS:

LENGTH:
- IC memo: 8-15 pages (excl. appendix)
- Deal summary: 2-3 pages
- Quick screen: 1 page

VISUAL HIERARCHY:
- Executive summary: bold key numbers
- Use tables for comparisons (not paragraphs)
- Charts for trends (revenue, margins, cohorts)
- Red/yellow/green for risk ratings

APPENDIX ITEMS:
- Detailed financial model
- Full cap table
- Customer reference notes
- Competitive feature matrix
- Org chart
- Term sheet
```
