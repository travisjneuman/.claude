# Travel Planner

Comprehensive travel planning frameworks for destination research, itinerary building, budget tracking, and logistics coordination.

## Destination Research Methodology

### Destination Evaluation Matrix

| Factor | Weight | Assessment Criteria |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Climate** | 15% | Temperature range, rainfall, best season, weather risks |
| **Safety** | 20% | Travel advisories, crime index, health risks, political stability |
| **Budget Fit** | 20% | Cost of living index, flight cost, accommodation range |
| **Interest Alignment** | 25% | Activities, culture, cuisine, nature, nightlife match |
| **Logistics** | 10% | Visa requirements, flight duration, language barrier |
| **Timing** | 10% | Peak vs shoulder vs off-season, local events, holidays |

### Research Protocol

```
1. DEFINE: Trip purpose, travel dates, group size, budget ceiling
2. SHORTLIST: 3-5 destinations matching purpose and budget
3. EVALUATE: Score each destination on the matrix above (1-10 per factor)
4. VALIDATE: Check visa requirements, travel advisories, vaccination needs
5. DECIDE: Weighted score comparison, gut-check alignment
```

### Climate and Timing Guide

| Season Strategy | Benefit | Trade-off |
|----------------|---------|-----------|
| **Peak season** | Best weather, full services | Highest prices, crowds |
| **Shoulder season** | Good weather, fewer crowds | Some closures possible |
| **Off-season** | Lowest prices, authentic feel | Weather risk, limited services |

## Itinerary Structure

```

### Itinerary Pacing Guidelines

| Trip Duration | Pace | Activities/Day | Rest Days |
|--------------|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **3-4 days** | Moderate-fast | 2-3 major | 0 |
| **5-7 days** | Moderate | 2 major + 1 minor | 1 |
| **8-14 days** | Relaxed | 1-2 major | 2-3 |
| **15+ days** | Slow travel | 1 major | Every 3-4 days |

### Multi-Destination Routing

```
ROUTING OPTIMIZATION:

LINEAR: A → B → C → D (best for one-way flights, trains)
LOOP: A → B → C → A (best for round-trip flights)
HUB-SPOKE: A → B → A → C → A (best for day trips from a base)
FIGURE-8: A → B → C → A → D → E → A (two loops from home base)

ROUTING RULES:
- Minimize backtracking
- Place high-energy activities early in trip
- End with relaxation before travel home
- Account for jet lag direction (east = harder adjustment)
- Allocate transit days between destinations (no activities)
```

## Budget Planning Framework

### Budget Category Breakdown

| Category | Budget % | Tracking Method |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Flights** | 25-35% | Book 6-8 weeks ahead, price alerts |

| **Food & Dining** | 15-20% | Per-day allowance x days |
| **Activities** | 10-15% | Pre-book major, cash for minor |
| **Local Transport** | 5-10% | Day pass vs per-ride calculation |
| **Contingency** | 10% | Emergency fund, minimum $200 |

## Transportation Planning

### Inter-City Transport Decision Matrix

|--------|--------|-------|-----|------------|
| **Best for distance** | 500+ km | 200-800 km | 50-400 km | Flexible routing |

### Airport Transfer Planning

```
AIRPORT TRANSFER OPTIONS (evaluate for each destination):

PUBLIC TRANSIT: Cheapest, may require transfers, luggage challenge
AIRPORT EXPRESS: Direct train/bus, good balance of cost and convenience
SHARED SHUTTLE: Moderate cost, door-to-door, longer due to stops
PRIVATE TRANSFER: Pre-booked, door-to-door, fixed price
TAXI/RIDESHARE: Convenient, meter or surge pricing risk
RENTAL CAR: Best if driving during trip anyway

SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Group size (3+ people = private transfer often cheaper than 3 tickets)
- Luggage volume
- Arrival time (late night = fewer public transit options)
- Language barrier (pre-booked = less negotiation)
```

## Dining Recommendations Approach

### Restaurant Research Framework

```
DINING RESEARCH SOURCES (ranked by reliability):
1. Local food blogs / city-specific food guides
2. Google Maps (4.0+ rating, 500+ reviews, read recent ones)
3. TripAdvisor (filter by cuisine, check recency)
4. Instagram geotags for the area
5. Hotel concierge / local recommendations
6. Food tour operators (for curated experiences)

FILTERING CRITERIA:
- Cuisine authenticity (locals eating there = good sign)
- Price range alignment with budget
- Location proximity to day's activities
- Reservation requirements
- Dietary accommodation capability
- Atmosphere match (casual lunch vs special dinner)
```

### Meal Budget Tiers

| Tier | Description | Per-Person Range |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **$** | Street food, markets, fast casual | $5-15 |
| **$$** | Local restaurants, casual dining | $15-30 |
