### 1. Talent Acquisition Strategy

#### Strategic Framework

Fortune 50 talent acquisition operates as a strategic business function, not transactional recruiting. Best-in-class programs focus on:

**The AARRR Talent Acquisition Model**

1. **Acquisition**: Attract and hire through employer branding and structured selection
2. **Activation**: Onboard new hires with mentorship and clear goal-setting
3. **Retention**: Keep employees engaged through recognition, feedback, career development
4. **Referral**: Turn employees into brand ambassadors
5. **Renewal**: Develop future leaders through succession planning and knowledge transfer

#### Skills-Based Hiring Framework

Research shows skills-based hiring expands the talent pool by 2.6x compared to experience-only requirements.

**Implementation Checklist**

- [ ] Define core competencies and skills for each role (not just experience)
- [ ] Create structured interview protocols assessing demonstrated skills
- [ ] Build skills assessments and work simulations into selection process
- [ ] Train hiring managers on skills-based evaluation techniques
- [ ] Track time-to-hire, quality-of-hire, and diversity metrics
- [ ] Implement internal mobility programs (2.5x more predictive of retention)

#### Employer Branding Strategy

**Decision Tree: Building Employer Value Proposition (EVP)**

```
Is your EVP authentic to actual employee experience?
├─ YES → Is it differentiated from competitors?
│   ├─ YES → Is it communicated consistently across channels?
│   │   ├─ YES → Measure and optimize conversion rates
│   │   └─ NO → Create integrated brand campaign
│   └─ NO → Identify unique value drivers through employee research
└─ NO → Conduct employee listening sessions to understand reality
    └─ Close gaps between promise and experience
```

**Key EVP Elements for Fortune 50**

1. Meaningful work and impact at scale
2. Career development and internal mobility opportunities
3. Competitive total rewards (see Compensation section)
4. Inclusive culture and belonging
5. Flexibility and work-life integration
6. Innovation and technology enablement
7. Purpose-driven mission and values
8. Global opportunities and exposure

### 2. Performance Management Systems

#### Strategic Approach

Fortune 50 companies have shifted from annual reviews to continuous performance management that drives business results and employee development.

**Modern Performance Management Model**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Goal Setting (Quarterly OKRs)        │
│  Objectives + Key Results aligned to         │

│  succession planning inputs                  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### OKR Implementation Framework

**Objectives and Key Results** are the gold standard for Fortune 50 goal-setting.

**OKR Structure**

- **Objective**: Qualitative, inspirational, time-bound goal
- **Key Results**: 3-5 quantitative measures of success
- **Cadence**: Quarterly setting, weekly check-ins, quarterly reviews

**Example OKR (HR Leader)**

```
Objective: Build world-class engineering talent pipeline
Key Results:
  - Increase engineering hires from 50 to 120 this quarter
  - Achieve 50% diverse candidate slate for all engineering roles
  - Improve offer acceptance rate from 75% to 88%
  - Reduce time-to-fill for senior engineers from 60 to 40 days
```

**OKR Cascade Model**

```
Company OKRs (CEO level)
    ↓
Division OKRs (Business unit leaders)
    ↓
Department OKRs (Functional leaders)
    ↓
Team OKRs (Managers)
    ↓
Individual OKRs (All employees)
```

#### Competency Framework Design

**Core vs. Functional vs. Leadership Competencies**

| Competency Type | Who             | Examples                                                                  |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core**        | All employees   | Collaboration, Communication, Customer Focus, Innovation, Integrity       |
| **Functional**  | Specific roles  | Technical Expertise, Domain Knowledge, Analytical Skills                  |
| **Leadership**  | People managers | Strategic Thinking, Developing Others, Driving Results, Change Leadership |

**Competency Assessment Methods**

1. **Self-Assessment**: Employee rates themselves
2. **Manager Assessment**: Direct manager evaluation
3. **360 Feedback**: Peers, direct reports, stakeholders (for leaders)
4. **Calibration Sessions**: Leadership team aligns on ratings
5. **Skills Testing**: Objective assessments where applicable

#### Performance Rating Approach

**Recommended Distribution Curve (Forced Ranking vs. Guideline)**

Most Fortune 50 companies have moved away from forced ranking to guided distributions:

| Rating | Label          | Target % | Description                                           |
| ------ | -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 5      | Exceptional    | 5-10%    | Consistently exceeds expectations, exceptional impact |
| 4      | Exceeds        | 20-25%   | Frequently exceeds expectations, strong performance   |
| 3      | Meets          | 50-60%   | Consistently meets expectations, solid performer      |
| 2      | Below          | 10-15%   | Sometimes meets expectations, needs improvement       |
| 1      | Unsatisfactory | 0-5%     | Does not meet expectations, on performance plan       |

**Calibration Process**

1. Managers submit preliminary ratings
2. Leadership team reviews distribution and outliers
3. Evidence-based discussion on borderline cases
4. Adjust ratings for consistency and fairness
5. Document rationale for all ratings of 1 or 5
6. Final approval by senior leadership

#### Performance Management Technology

**Essential Platform Capabilities**

- [ ] Goal setting and tracking (OKR management)
- [ ] Continuous feedback and recognition
- [ ] 1:1 meeting notes and action items
- [ ] 360 feedback collection and reporting
- [ ] Performance review workflows and calibration tools
- [ ] Analytics and dashboards (completion rates, rating distributions)
- [ ] Integration with HRIS and compensation systems
- [ ] Mobile accessibility for managers and employees

**Leading Platforms**: Workday, SuccessFactors, BetterUp, Lattice, 15Five, Betterworks

#### Building Your Compensation Philosophy

**The 4-Step Framework**

**Step 1: Define Competitive Positioning**
Where do you want to pay relative to market?

| Percentile | Strategy | When to Use                                          |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 75th-90th  | Lead     | High-demand talent, competitive markets, growth mode |
| 50th-60th  | Match    | Most roles, stable talent market, budget constraints |
| 40th-50th  | Lag      | Lower-skilled roles, supplemented with other rewards |

**Step 2: Define Market Comparators**
Who are you competing with for talent?

- Industry peers (e.g., other Fortune 50 consumer goods companies)
- Geographic market (e.g., Bay Area tech companies)
- Functional markets (e.g., top consulting firms for strategy roles)

**Step 3: Define Pay Mix Philosophy**
How much fixed vs. variable compensation?

**Executive Pay Mix (S&P 500 Median)**

- Base Salary: 15-20%
- Annual Bonus: 20-25%
- Long-Term Incentives (Equity): 55-60%

**Manager Pay Mix**

- Base Salary: 70-80%
- Annual Bonus: 20-30%

**Individual Contributor Pay Mix**

- Base Salary: 80-90%
- Annual Bonus: 10-20%

**Step 4: Define Pay Governance**
How do you make pay decisions?

- Salary bands with min/mid/max ranges
- Merit increase budgets (typically 3-4% annually)
- Promotion increase guidelines (typically 8-15%)
- Equity grant guidelines by level
- Off-cycle adjustment approval process

#### Executive Compensation Design

**Fortune 50 Best Practices**

**Long-Term Incentive Design**
| Component | % of LTI | Vesting | Performance Metrics |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------------------|
| Performance Shares (PSUs) | 50-60% | 3 years cliff | Relative TSR, Revenue Growth, ROIC, ESG Goals |
| Stock Options | 10-20% | 4 years ratable | Stock price appreciation |
| Restricted Stock (RSUs) | 30-40% | 3-4 years ratable | Time-based retention |

**ESG-Linked Compensation**
73% of S&P 500 companies now link executive pay to ESG metrics:

- Diversity hiring and representation goals
- Carbon reduction targets
- Safety metrics (injury rates)
- Employee engagement scores
- Customer satisfaction metrics

#### Pay Equity & Transparency

**Pay Equity Analysis Process**

1. **Data Collection**: Gather compensation data by role, level, demographics
2. **Comparator Groups**: Define comparable roles/levels for analysis
3. **Regression Analysis**: Control for legitimate pay factors (experience, performance, location)
4. **Identify Gaps**: Flag statistically significant pay differences
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Understand why gaps exist
6. **Remediation**: Adjust pay where gaps are not justified by legitimate factors
7. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Quarterly or annual re-analysis

**Pay Transparency Levels**

| Level | What's Shared                      | Fortune 50 Adoption           |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1     | Salary ranges in job postings      | 40% (required in some states) |
| 2     | Salary bands published internally  | 25%                           |
| 3     | Individual salaries visible to all | <5% (rare in Fortune 50)      |

#### Compensation Metrics

| Metric                | Definition                                | Target                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Compa-Ratio           | Actual salary / midpoint of range         | 80-120%                                        |
| Pay Equity Gap        | % pay difference for similar work         | <5% (after controlling for legitimate factors) |
| Incentive Payout %    | Actual bonus / target bonus               | 80-120% (varies by performance)                |
| Total Rewards ROI     | Revenue per employee / total rewards cost | Industry-specific                              |
| Compensation Budget % | Total comp expense / revenue              | 30-50% (varies by industry)                    |

3. **Processes**: Define workflows, decision rights, information flows
4. **Rewards**: Align compensation and incentives to desired behaviors
5. **People**: Build talent strategy and capabilities

#### Span of Control & Layers

**Fortune 50 Benchmarks**

| Level     | Typical Span        | Max Layers from CEO |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| CEO       | 8-12 direct reports | 0                   |
| C-Suite   | 6-10 direct reports | 1                   |
| Senior VP | 6-10 direct reports | 2-3                 |
| VP        | 6-10 direct reports | 3-4                 |
| Director  | 6-10 direct reports | 4-5                 |
| Manager   | 5-8 direct reports  | 5-6                 |
| Frontline | 8-15 direct reports | 6-7                 |

**Delayering Decision Criteria**

- [ ] Are there decision bottlenecks?
- [ ] Are managers managing managers with no unique value-add?
- [ ] Can we push decision-making closer to customers?
- [ ] Are we slower than competitors?
- [ ] Is manager:employee ratio too low?

#### Shared Services Design

**Decision: Centralize, Decentralize, or Hybrid?**

| Function      | Centralize                                | Decentralize                      | Hybrid        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Finance**   | Transactional accounting, treasury        | Business partnering, FP&A         | ✓ Most common |
| **HR**        | Payroll, benefits, compliance             | Recruiting, HRBP support          | ✓ Most common |
| **IT**        | Infrastructure, security, enterprise apps | End-user support, app development | ✓ Most common |
| **Legal**     | Corporate, M&A, compliance                | Contract support                  | ✓ Most common |
| **Marketing** | Brand strategy, analytics                 | Campaign execution, content       | ✓ Most common |

**Shared Services Success Factors**

1. Clear service level agreements (SLAs)
2. Chargeback or allocation model for funding
3. Governance model for prioritization
4. Strong relationship management between shared services and business units
5. Technology platforms that enable self-service

┌───────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│         BEHAVIORS & NORMS               │
│  What leaders and employees actually do │
└───────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                │
┌───────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│         ARTIFACTS & SYMBOLS             │

| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Annual Engagement Survey** | Yearly            | Comprehensive assessment, trends over time |
| **Pulse Surveys**            | Quarterly         | Quick check-ins on specific topics         |
| **New Hire Surveys**         | 30/60/90 days     | Onboarding experience, first impressions   |
| **Exit Surveys**             | At departure      | Understand why employees leave             |

- [ ] Include free-text for qualitative insights
- [ ] Ensure confidentiality (minimum group size of 5 for reporting)
- [ ] Ask "What should we start/stop/continue doing?"
- [ ] Benchmark against external datasets (Gallup, Culture Amp, etc.)

#### Manager Effectiveness Framework

**The #1 Driver of Engagement: Your Direct Manager**

Gallup research shows managers account for 70% of variance in employee engagement.

**The 5 Conversations Every Manager Must Have**

1. **Role & Expectations** (Onboarding & Ongoing)
   - What is expected of me?
   - How does my work contribute to team/company goals?

2. **Strengths & Development** (Quarterly)
   - What am I great at?
   - What should I develop further?

3. **Performance Feedback** (Continuous)
   - How am I doing?
   - What can I improve?

4. **Career Development** (Quarterly)
   - Where do I want to grow?
   - What opportunities are available?

5. **Well-Being & Connection** (Ongoing)
   - How are you doing as a person?
   - What support do you need?

| **Ready Now**        | Who could step in within 3 months?         |
| **Ready 1-2 Years**  | Who could be ready with development?       |
| **Ready 3-5 Years**  | Future pipeline candidates                 |
| **Competency Gaps**  | What skills do successors need to develop? |
| **Development Plan** | Specific actions to close gaps             |

## Decision Trees & Checklists

### When to Hire vs. Develop Talent

```
Do we need this capability urgently (<3 months)?
├─ YES → Do we have internal candidates who could step up?
│   ├─ YES → Promote internally + backfill their role
│   └─ NO → Hire externally
└─ NO → Do we have high-potential employees who could grow into this?
    ├─ YES → Invest in development + interim solution
    └─ NO → Start external search now for future need
```

### Compensation Decision Tree

```
Employee requests raise or external offer received

Step 1: Is employee a high performer? (rating 4 or 5)
├─ NO → Decline or minimal adjustment, focus on performance
└─ YES → Continue

Step 2: Is employee below market for their role/level?
├─ NO → Consider role/scope expansion or promotion
└─ YES → Continue

Step 3: Is employee flight risk or critical to business?
├─ NO → Standard merit increase cycle
└─ YES → Off-cycle adjustment to market

Step 4: Do we have budget?
├─ YES → Make competitive offer
└─ NO → Get approval or accept loss
```

### Organizational Restructuring Checklist

- [ ] Business case: Why is change needed? What problem are we solving?
- [ ] Strategic alignment: Does new structure support business strategy?
- [ ] Span and layers: Are we reducing unnecessary management layers?
- [ ] Decision rights: Are decisions made at the right level?
- [ ] Leadership alignment: Do executives support the change?
- [ ] People impact: How many moves, role changes, reductions?
- [ ] Financial impact: What are the costs and savings?
- [ ] Change management plan: How will we communicate and support transition?
- [ ] Risk mitigation: What could go wrong? How do we mitigate?
- [ ] Success metrics: How will we measure success?
