<objective>
Audit and enhance 3 finance/risk domain skills: finance, risk-management, legal-compliance.

Purpose: Ensure finance/risk domain skills meet P0/P1/P2 quality standards and stay under 500-line threshold.
Output: 3 enhanced SKILL.md files with content split to references/ where needed.

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- P0/P1/P2 tiered structure prevents instruction overload (Phase 1)
- SKILL.md under 500 lines, split to references/ when approaching 400 (Phase 1)
- Task-focused descriptions for reliable activation (Research)

**Current skill sizes (audit targets):**
- finance: 430 lines (under threshold, verify quality)
- risk-management: 564 lines (OVER threshold - must split)
- legal-compliance: 414 lines (under threshold, verify quality)

**Audit focus:**
- Not rebuilding - auditing and polishing
- Verify references/ folder exists for deep content
- Ensure SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Confirm 3+ frameworks present
- Task-focused descriptions

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Audit and optimize finance</name>
  <files>skills/finance/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
    Read SKILL.md (430 lines) and run P0 checklist:
    1. Description is task-focused
    2. Under 500 lines (passes at 430)
    3. No padding/filler content - look for removable sections
    4. 3+ recognized frameworks present (DCF, LBO, comparable companies, etc.)
    5. Templates are actionable

    If padding found: Remove to bring under 400 lines.
    Check if references/ folder exists with detailed models.
    Document audit results.

  <files>skills/risk-management/SKILL.md, skills/risk-management/references/</files>
  <action>
    SKILL.md is 564 lines - OVER 500 threshold. Must split:

    1. Read full SKILL.md, identify deep content suitable for references/
    2. Create references/ folder if not exists
    3. Move detailed frameworks (ERM, risk matrices, comprehensive assessments) to references/
    4. Keep core patterns, decision trees, quick reference in SKILL.md
    5. Add explicit links to references/
    6. Target: SKILL.md under 400 lines

    P0 checklist after split:
    - Description task-focused
    - Under 500 lines (target <400)
    - No padding
    - 3+ frameworks referenced
  </action>
  <verify>wc -l skills/risk-management/SKILL.md shows under 500 lines</verify>
