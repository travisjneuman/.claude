## Risk Assessment

### Risk Assessment Process

```
RISK ASSESSMENT STEPS:

1. RISK IDENTIFICATION
   - Environmental scanning
   - Stakeholder interviews
   - Workshop facilitation
   - Historical analysis
   - Scenario analysis

2. RISK ANALYSIS
   - Probability assessment
   - Impact assessment
   - Velocity consideration
   - Control effectiveness

3. RISK EVALUATION
   - Risk prioritization
   - Comparison to appetite
   - Aggregation analysis
   - Interdependency mapping

4. RISK RESPONSE
   - Accept (within appetite)
   - Mitigate (reduce likelihood/impact)
   - Transfer (insurance, contracts)
   - Avoid (eliminate activity)

5. MONITORING & REPORTING
   - Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
   - Risk dashboards
   - Escalation triggers
   - Periodic reassessment
```

### Risk Heat Map

```
RISK MATRIX:

         IMPACT
         Low    Medium    High    Critical
LIKELIHOOD
Very High   3      6        9        12
High        2      4        6         9

Low         1      1        2         3

SCORING:
1-2: Accept/Monitor
3-4: Active Management
6: Senior Management Attention
