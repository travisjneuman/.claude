# Project State

## Project Summary

**Building:** Transform Claude Code skills library from basic guidelines into expert-level knowledge systems

**Core requirements:**
- Skills auto-activate on natural language
- Guidance feels expert-level (matches seasoned professionals)
- Token efficiency maintained (lean SKILL.md + deep references/)
- All ~40 skills brought to consistent quality
- Descriptions are task-focused, not qualifier-focused

**Constraints:**
- Token efficiency: Core SKILL.md under 500 lines (~5-10KB)
- Backward compatibility: Existing activation still works
- Research-backed: Based on recognized best practices
- Self-contained: Skills work without external dependencies

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 6 (Validation)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: **PROJECT COMPLETE**
Last activity: 2025-12-17 - Completed 06-02-PLAN.md

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 0 | Base skills first | 3-4x multiplier effect on stack variants |
| 0 | Group domain skills by affinity | Efficient batch processing (4 skills per plan) |
| 0 | Research pre-completed | Stack/implementation/risks research done upfront |
| 1-01 | Three distinct templates by skill type | Domain/code/utility have fundamentally different structures |
| 1-01 | P0/P1/P2 tiered checklist | Prevents instruction overload (research: >10 = 19% drop) |
| 1-02 | Lean shared standards (<150 lines each) | Token efficiency when referenced by multiple skills |
