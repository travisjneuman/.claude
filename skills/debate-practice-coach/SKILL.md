# Debate Practice Coach

Frameworks for structured argumentation, counterargument development, logical analysis, and persuasive communication practice with objective scoring.

## Argument Structure

### Toulmin Model of Argumentation

```
ARGUMENT BUILDER (Toulmin Model):

CLAIM:        [Your main assertion]
              What are you arguing?

GROUNDS:      [Evidence and data supporting the claim]
              What facts back this up?

WARRANT:      [The logical connection between grounds and claim]
              Why does this evidence support your claim?

BACKING:      [Support for the warrant itself]
              Why should we trust this reasoning?

QUALIFIER:    [Degree of certainty — most, some, probably]
              How strong is this claim?

REBUTTAL:     [Conditions where the claim doesn't hold]
              When would this argument fail?

EXAMPLE:
  Claim:      "Remote work increases productivity for knowledge workers."
  Grounds:    "Stanford study showed 13% productivity increase in remote workers."
  Warrant:    "Fewer interruptions and commute elimination allow deeper focus."
  Backing:    "Multiple studies confirm interruptions cost 23 min to recover from."
  Qualifier:  "For most knowledge workers in roles not requiring physical presence."
  Rebuttal:   "May not apply to new employees needing mentorship or highly
               collaborative creative roles."
```

### Argument Types

| Type | Structure | Best For | Example |
|------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Deductive** | If premises true → conclusion must be true | Logical proofs, policy arguments | "All citizens must follow laws. X is a citizen. Therefore X must follow laws." |
| **Inductive** | Specific observations → general conclusion | Scientific arguments, trend analysis | "In 50 studies, X led to Y. Therefore X likely causes Y." |
| **Abductive** | Best available explanation | Diagnostic arguments | "The best explanation for these symptoms is condition X." |
| **Analogical** | Similar case → similar conclusion | Precedent-based arguments | "Policy X worked in Country A, which shares characteristics with Country B." |
| **Causal** | X causes Y | Policy proposals, problem-solution | "Increasing minimum wage will reduce poverty because..." |

## Counterargument Generation

### Counterargument Framework

```
COUNTERARGUMENT WORKSHEET:

ORIGINAL ARGUMENT: [State the argument you're opposing]

STRATEGY 1 — CHALLENGE THE EVIDENCE:
  "The evidence cited is flawed because..."
  - Data is outdated: [Explain]
  - Sample size insufficient: [Explain]
  - Source is biased: [Explain]
  - Correlation ≠ causation: [Explain]

STRATEGY 2 — CHALLENGE THE REASONING:
  "Even if the evidence is correct, the conclusion doesn't follow because..."
  - Logical gap between evidence and claim: [Explain]
  - Alternative explanation for the data: [Explain]
  - False dichotomy (there are other options): [Explain]

STRATEGY 3 — CHALLENGE THE SIGNIFICANCE:
  "Even if the argument is valid, it doesn't matter because..."
  - The impact is overstated: [Explain]
  - Other factors are more important: [Explain]
  - The cost of the proposal outweighs the benefit: [Explain]

STRATEGY 4 — PROVIDE COUNTEREXAMPLES:
  "This argument fails in these real-world cases..."
  - Example 1: [Where the argument doesn't hold]
  - Example 2: [Where the opposite occurred]

STRONGEST COUNTER: [Select best strategy + compose your response]
```

### Steel Man Technique

```
STEEL MAN PROCESS:

Before arguing against a position, first construct the STRONGEST
possible version of your opponent's argument:

STEP 1: State their argument in your own words
  "[Opponent's position as I understand it]"

STEP 2: Check understanding
  "Is this a fair representation of your view?"

STEP 3: Strengthen it (add their best evidence)
  "In fact, the strongest version of this argument would include..."
  - Best available evidence for their position
  - Most charitable interpretation of their claims
  - Strongest logical chain supporting their conclusion

STEP 4: NOW respond to the strongest version
  "Even in its strongest form, this argument has the following problems..."

WHY STEEL MAN:
  - Demonstrates intellectual honesty
  - Prevents straw man fallacy
  - Your counter is more persuasive when addressing the best version
  - Builds credibility with the audience
  - Forces you to deeply understand the issue
```

## Logical Fallacies Reference

### Common Fallacies

| Fallacy | Definition | Example | Response |
|---------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Ad Hominem** | Attacking the person, not the argument | "You can't trust their economic analysis, they didn't finish college." | "The argument's validity is independent of who makes it. Let's examine the evidence." |
| **Straw Man** | Misrepresenting the argument to attack it | "You want to reduce military spending? So you don't care about national security?" | "That's not my position. I said [actual position]." |
| **Appeal to Authority** | Citing an authority outside their expertise | "A famous actor says vaccines are dangerous." | "What do the relevant experts (epidemiologists) say?" |
| **False Dichotomy** | Presenting only two options when more exist | "Either we ban all cars or accept pollution." | "There are many intermediate options: electric vehicles, public transit, emissions standards." |
| **Slippery Slope** | Claiming one event will inevitably lead to extreme outcomes | "If we allow X, next thing you know Y and Z will happen." | "What evidence exists that X actually leads to Y? Each step requires its own justification." |
| **Circular Reasoning** | Using the conclusion as a premise | "This policy is good because it's the right thing to do." | "You're assuming what you're trying to prove. Why is it the right thing?" |
| **Red Herring** | Introducing an irrelevant topic | "We should discuss education funding." "But what about the economy?" | "That's a separate issue. Let's stay focused on education funding." |
| **Bandwagon** | Appealing to popularity | "Everyone believes X, so X must be true." | "Popularity doesn't determine truth. What does the evidence show?" |
| **Appeal to Emotion** | Using emotion instead of logic | "Think of the children!" (without relevant evidence) | "I share your concern, but let's examine what the data actually shows." |
| **Hasty Generalization** | Drawing broad conclusions from limited examples | "I know two people who failed, so the program doesn't work." | "Two cases isn't enough to evaluate the program. What do the aggregate results show?" |
