<objective>
Create the enhancement template and quality checklist that will guide all skill enhancement work.

Purpose: Establish consistent structure and quality bar for enhancing ~40 skills
Output: Template file and checklist in .planning/templates/ that all subsequent phases will use
</objective>

@.planning/research/risks.md

**Prior decisions affecting this plan:**
- Token-optimized structure: SKILL.md (~5-10KB) + references/ for deep content (from research)
- P0/P1/P2 tiered priority systems for checklists (from risks research)
- Task-focused descriptions for reliable activation (from implementation research)

**Key research findings to incorporate:**
- SKILL.md should be under 500 lines for optimal performance
- Description field is for discovery (task verbs, natural language), not documentation
- 3+ recognized frameworks required for expert-level quality
- Include self-critique steps for technical output skills
- Instruction overload (>10 rules) causes 19% performance drop - use tiered priorities

**Existing patterns to follow:**
@skills/generic-code-reviewer/SKILL.md (good example: 104 lines, references _shared/)
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create skill enhancement template</name>
  <files>.planning/templates/skill-enhancement-template.md</files>
  <action>
Create a template that defines the structure every enhanced skill should follow.

Structure to include:
1. **YAML frontmatter section** - name (lowercase-hyphen), description (task-focused, triggers)
2. **Core SKILL.md structure** - sections, size limits, what belongs where
3. **references/ structure** - when to split, naming conventions, content guidelines
4. **Progressive disclosure architecture** - Level 1 (metadata) → Level 2 (body) → Level 3 (references)

Template should show:
- Exact YAML frontmatter format with description field guidance
- Section headers for expert skills (Core Frameworks, Decision Trees, Quick Reference)
- Section headers for code skills (Tech Stack Detection, Priority Tiers, Output Format)
- Section headers for utility skills (When to Use, Workflow Steps, Quality Checklist)
- How to link to references/ with explicit decision points
- Size thresholds (500 lines / ~10KB for SKILL.md)

Include "DO NOT" anti-patterns from risks.md research:
- No monolithic skills (split to references/)
- No theory without application
- No instruction overload (use P0/P1/P2 tiers)
- No padding/filler content
- No vague activation descriptions

Template should be directly usable - not just guidelines, but actual markdown structure to copy.
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists at .planning/templates/skill-enhancement-template.md
- Template includes YAML frontmatter example
- Template includes section structure for all 3 skill types (domain expert, code, utility)
- Template includes size thresholds and anti-patterns
- Template is under 300 lines (it's a template, not comprehensive docs)
  </verify>
  <done>
Template file exists with complete structure for all skill types, ready to use as starting point for skill enhancement
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create quality verification checklist</name>
  <files>.planning/templates/skill-quality-checklist.md</files>
  <action>
Create a checklist that validates skill quality before considering enhancement complete.

Structure with tiered priorities:

**P0 - Must Pass (Blocking):**
- Activation quality (description is task-focused, matches natural language)
- Structure compliance (SKILL.md under 500 lines, references/ for deep content)
- No anti-patterns (no padding, no theory without application, no >10 instructions flat)

**P1 - Expert Quality (Should Pass):**
- Framework coverage (3+ recognized frameworks from domain leaders)
- Actionable guidance (templates, specific thresholds, step-by-step processes)
- Self-critique step (for technical output skills)

**P2 - Polish (Nice to Have):**
- Cross-skill references where applicable
- Consistent terminology with other skills
- Examples show variation (2-3 carefully selected, not 10)

Include specific verification questions:
- "Can I remove any section without reducing task performance?" (padding test)
- "Would 'help me with [task]' activate this skill?" (activation test)
- "Can Claude execute after reading, or just explain?" (actionable test)
- "Are there >10 flat instructions?" (overload test - refactor to hierarchy)

Checklist should be scannable in under 2 minutes.
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists at .planning/templates/skill-quality-checklist.md
- Checklist has P0/P1/P2 tiered structure
- Includes specific verification questions from research
- Includes activation testing guidance
- Under 150 lines (scannable checklist, not documentation)
  </verify>
  <done>
Quality checklist exists with tiered priorities and specific verification questions, ready to use for skill validation
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create .planning/templates/ directory and verify structure</name>
  <files>.planning/templates/README.md</files>
  <action>
Create a brief README in .planning/templates/ that:
1. Lists the templates and their purpose
2. Shows how to use them during skill enhancement
3. Links to research files for deeper context

Content should be minimal - just an index, not documentation.

Structure:
```markdown
# Enhancement Templates

## Files

- `skill-enhancement-template.md` - Structure template for enhanced skills
- `skill-quality-checklist.md` - Validation checklist (P0/P1/P2)

## Usage

1. Copy relevant section from template to new/existing skill
2. Fill in domain-specific content
3. Run quality checklist before marking complete

## Research Context

- `.planning/research/implementation.md` - Current skill authoring patterns
- `.planning/research/risks.md` - Anti-patterns to avoid
- `.planning/research/stack.md` - Domain-specific frameworks
```

Keep under 50 lines.
  </action>
  <verify>
- .planning/templates/ directory exists
- README.md exists and lists both template files
- README includes usage instructions
- README links to research files
- README under 50 lines
  </verify>
  <done>
Templates directory has README index, making it easy to discover and use templates during subsequent phases
