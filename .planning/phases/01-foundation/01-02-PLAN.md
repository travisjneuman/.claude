<objective>
Enhance shared standards in skills/_shared/ folder to support all code review, design, and UX skills.

Purpose: Prevent duplication across stack-specific skills by centralizing common standards
Output: Updated _shared/ files that all generic-* and stack-specific skills can reference
</objective>

**Prior decisions affecting this plan:**
- SKILL.md + references/ structure for token optimization
- Shared standards in _shared/ folder to avoid duplication (from implementation research)
- P0/P1/P2 tiered priority systems (from risks research)

**Existing files to enhance:**
@skills/_shared/CODE_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md (113 lines - good base, needs tiered priorities)
@skills/_shared/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md (needs review)
@skills/_shared/UX_PRINCIPLES.md (needs review)

**Pattern to follow:**
@skills/generic-code-reviewer/SKILL.md (references _shared/ correctly)

**Key requirements from research:**
- Tiered priorities (P0/P1/P2) instead of flat checklists
- Specific thresholds/numbers (not vague "good performance")
- Action-oriented structure (Claude executes, not just explains)
- Under 500 lines per file for optimal loading

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Enhance CODE_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md with tiered priorities</name>
  <files>skills/_shared/CODE_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md</files>
  <action>
Restructure the existing CODE_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md to use tiered priorities.

Current state: 113 lines, flat checklist structure
Target: P0/P1/P2 tiered structure with clear blocking vs advisory issues

Changes to make:
1. Add P0 (Blocking - Must Fix) section at top with:
   - Type Safety: No `any` types, strict mode
   - Security: No innerHTML, no exposed secrets, input sanitization
   - Error Handling: Async try/catch, no dangling promises
   - Data Integrity: State mutations properly handled

2. Add P1 (Should Fix) section:
   - Function size (<50 lines guideline, flag >75)
   - Accessibility basics (contrast, keyboard, ARIA)
   - Performance (no obvious N+1, unnecessary re-renders)

3. Add P2 (Nice to Have) section:
   - Documentation for complex logic
   - Code style consistency
   - Micro-optimizations

4. Add "When to Flex Rules" section explaining exceptions

5. Add "Review Output Format" showing how to report issues (only report found issues, not empty categories)

Keep existing security/performance/accessibility content but reorganize into tiers.
Preserve good content from current file.
Stay under 200 lines (this is shared reference, not comprehensive docs).
  </action>
  <verify>
- File has P0/P1/P2 tiered structure
- P0 section includes type safety, security, error handling
- Includes "When to Flex Rules" exceptions guidance
- Includes "Review Output Format" template
- Under 200 lines
- Existing good content preserved (security checks, performance targets)

  <done>
CODE_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md has tiered priority structure that all code review skills can reference

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Review and enhance DESIGN_PATTERNS.md</name>
  <files>skills/_shared/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md</files>
  <action>
First read current file to assess state, then enhance.

Target structure (based on stack.md research):
1. **Atomic Design Framework** - Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates
2. **Design Token Structure** - Colors, Typography, Spacing, Shadows
3. **Component Documentation Standard** - Names, props, states, code snippets
4. **Responsive Breakpoints** - Standard breakpoint values
5. **Animation Principles** - GPU-accelerated, 60fps, requestAnimationFrame

Include specific thresholds:
- Color contrast >= 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)
- Touch targets >= 44x44px
- Animation duration guidelines (150-300ms for micro, 300-500ms for transitions)

Keep actionable and scannable.
Under 200 lines.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Review and enhance UX_PRINCIPLES.md</name>
  <files>skills/_shared/UX_PRINCIPLES.md</files>
  <action>
First read current file to assess state, then enhance.

Target structure (based on stack.md research on UX methods):
1. **UX Research Methods** - When to use which method
   - User interviews (75% usage per UXPA 2024)
   - Usability testing (69% usage)
   - Heuristic evaluation (50% usage)

2. **Heuristic Evaluation Framework** - Nielsen's 10 heuristics, quick reference

3. **Usability Testing Process** - Step-by-step for moderated testing

4. **Quick Critique Framework** - For fast UX feedback
   - Clarity (understand in <3 seconds?)
   - Efficiency (minimum steps?)
   - Consistency (matches existing patterns?)
   - Accessibility (everyone can use?)

Include decision guidance:
- When to do full research vs quick critique
- When to use quantitative vs qualitative methods

Keep actionable and scannable.

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] CODE_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md has P0/P1/P2 structure
- [ ] DESIGN_PATTERNS.md has atomic design and design tokens
- [ ] UX_PRINCIPLES.md has research methods and quick critique framework
- [ ] All files under 200 lines each
- [ ] All files have specific thresholds/numbers where applicable
- [ ] Existing skills still reference these files correctly (no broken links)

<success_criteria>
- All 3 _shared/ files enhanced with actionable, tiered content
- Each file under 200 lines (lean shared references)
- Specific numbers and thresholds included (not vague guidance)
- Structure supports both quick reference and comprehensive review
- Phase 1 Foundation complete
