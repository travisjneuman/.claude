### Competitive Positioning Matrix

```
POSITIONING MAP:

                    HIGH CAPABILITY
                         |
                         |
     NICHE LEADER        |        MARKET LEADER
     (deep in segment)   |        (broad + deep)
                         |
   ─────────────────────+──────────────────────
     LOW REACH           |        HIGH REACH
                         |
     EMERGING PLAYER     |        BROAD PLAYER
     (limited scope)     |        (wide but shallow)
                         |
                    LOW CAPABILITY

POSITION US: [where we sit]
POSITION COMPETITOR: [where they sit]
NARRATIVE: "While [Competitor] covers more ground, we go deeper
            in [our segment] where it matters most for [buyer]."
```

### Differentiation Categories

| Category | Our Position | Competitor Position | Talking Point |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Product** | [specific feature/capability] | [their approach] | [why ours matters] |
| **Technology** | [architecture/approach] | [their architecture] | [technical advantage] |
| **Service** | [support model] | [their support model] | [customer impact] |
| **Price** | [pricing model] | [their pricing model] | [value story] |
| **Market Focus** | [our ICP] | [their ICP] | [specialization benefit] |
| **Integration** | [ecosystem fit] | [their ecosystem] | [workflow advantage] |
| **Security** | [certifications/approach] | [their posture] | [trust factor] |

## Objection Handling Templates

### Objection Response Framework

```
STRUCTURE FOR EVERY OBJECTION:

ACKNOWLEDGE: Validate the concern without agreeing
BRIDGE:      Transition to your perspective
RESPOND:     Address with evidence and specifics
EVIDENCE:    Proof point (customer, data, demo)

EXAMPLE:

OBJECTION: "[Competitor] has more integrations than you."

ACKNOWLEDGE: "Integration breadth is important — I understand
              why that's a factor in your evaluation."

BRIDGE: "What we've found with customers in your space is that
         it's less about the total number and more about depth
         of the integrations you actually use."

RESPOND: "We have 40+ integrations focused on [their stack],
          with bi-directional sync and real-time data flow.
          [Competitor]'s integrations are often one-directional
          or require manual configuration."

EVIDENCE: "[Customer X] evaluated both and chose us specifically
           because our [specific integration] saved their team
           12 hours per week vs. the manual workaround with
           [Competitor]'s connector."
```

### Common Objection Categories

```
PRICING OBJECTIONS:
- "They're cheaper"
- "We can't justify the premium"
- "Their free tier is sufficient"

FEATURE OBJECTIONS:
- "They have [feature] that you don't"
- "Their product does more"
- "We need [specific capability]"

MARKET OBJECTIONS:
- "They're the market leader"
- "Everyone in our industry uses them"
- "They have more customers like us"

RISK OBJECTIONS:
- "They're a bigger, safer company"
- "What if you get acquired?"
- "We're already using them and switching is risky"

RELATIONSHIP OBJECTIONS:
- "We already have a contract with them"
- "Our team is trained on their platform"
- "Our exec has a personal relationship there"
```

## Win Theme Templates

### Discovery Questions That Favor Us

```
QUESTION DESIGN PRINCIPLE:
Ask questions whose honest answers reveal competitor weaknesses
without mentioning the competitor by name.

FORMAT:
Question → Expected Answer → Bridge to Our Strength

EXAMPLES:

Q: "How important is [our strength area] to your workflow?"
A: [Prospect describes importance]
B: "That's exactly where we've invested most deeply..."

Q: "What's your experience been with [pain our product solves]?"
A: [Prospect describes pain]
B: "We hear that a lot from teams who've used [category]. Here's
    how we approach it differently..."

Q: "When you evaluated solutions before, what fell short?"
A: [Prospect describes gaps]
B: "Those are the exact gaps we were built to fill..."
```

### Landmine Questions

```
LANDMINE STRATEGY:
Plant questions the prospect will ask the competitor that
expose their weaknesses.

TEMPLATE:
"When you're evaluating [Competitor], you might want to ask
them about [specific weakness area]. Specifically:

1. [Question about their known limitation]
2. [Question about their pricing gotcha]
3. [Question about their support gap]

These are areas where we've seen prospects get surprised during
implementation, and it's worth clarifying upfront."

RULES:
- Never lie or exaggerate competitor weaknesses
- Base landmines on documented, verified issues
- Keep it professional — attack the product, not the people
- Be prepared for the competitor to do the same to you
```

## Pricing Comparison Framework

### Pricing Analysis Template

```
PRICING COMPARISON:

                    US              COMPETITOR
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Model:              [per seat]      [per usage]
Entry Price:        $___/mo         $___/mo
Mid-Market:         $___/mo         $___/mo
Enterprise:         $___/mo         $___/mo

HIDDEN COSTS:
- Implementation:   [included]      [$X extra]
- Support:          [included]      [paid tier]
- Integrations:     [included]      [add-on]
- Storage/Usage:    [included]      [overage fees]

TRUE TCO (3-year, 100 users):
Us:         $______
Competitor: $______
Savings:    $______ (__%)

WIN NARRATIVE:
"While their list price appears [lower/similar], when you factor
in [hidden cost 1] and [hidden cost 2], the total cost of
ownership over 3 years is actually [X%] higher."
```
