**Current state:**
- codebase-documenter: 132 lines, good structure, needs verification workflow
- document-skills (pdf, docx, pptx, xlsx): Already robust file manipulation skills, skip

**Note:** document-skills are file format manipulation utilities (PDF merge, Excel read) -
they don't need the same enhancement pattern as codebase-documenter.
