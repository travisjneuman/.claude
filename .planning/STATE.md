# Project State

## Project Summary

**Building:** Universal Intelligent Router that handles ANY prompt by automatically loading relevant resources from 15 marketplaces, 69 skills, 37 agents, research capabilities, memory, and scientific tools.

**Status: COMPLETE**

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 3 (Validation)
Status: **READY TO COMMIT**
Last activity: Completed all documentation updates

Progress: █████████████░ 95%

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Universal Router ✓

- [x] Complete domain taxonomy (8 categories, 60+ domains)
- [x] Meta/Admin detection (highest priority)
- [x] Research detection (WebSearch triggers)
- [x] Decision framework routing
- [x] Scientific domain detection (8 domains → claude-scientific-skills)
- [x] Development domain detection (23 domains)
- [x] Business domain detection (16 domains)
- [x] Creative domain detection (6 domains)
- [x] Quality/Process detection (6 domains)
- [x] Exploration detection
- [x] Memory integration (claude-mem check/save)
- [x] Complexity scoring & routing logic
- [x] Post-work automation
- [x] Resource reference table (15 marketplaces)

**Deliverable:** `~/.claude/commands/start-task.md` v2.0

### Phase 2: Documentation Updates ✓

- [x] CLAUDE.md - Updated counts (69 skills, 37 agents, 15 marketplaces)
- [x] README.md - Complete rewrite with all capabilities
- [x] skills/README.md - Updated counts, added marketplace reference
- [x] skills/MASTER_INDEX.md - Updated counts, added marketplace section

**All documentation now accurate and comprehensive.**

### Phase 3: Validation

- [x] All files updated with correct counts
- [x] Router covers all domain types
- [ ] Commit changes
