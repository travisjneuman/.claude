<objective>
Enhance generic-ux-designer with UX research methods, heuristic evaluation framework, and quick critique workflow.

Purpose: The current skill at 115 lines covers psychology and patterns but lacks actionable research methods. This plan adds expert-level UX methodology that Phase 4 stack variants will inherit.
Output: Enhanced generic-ux-designer SKILL.md with research methods, Nielsen heuristics, and quick critique framework (~160-200 lines).

**Phase 1 templates for reference:**

**Shared standards (enhanced in Phase 1):**
@skills/_shared/UX_PRINCIPLES.md

**Current skill to enhance:**
@skills/generic-ux-designer/SKILL.md

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- Use Template A (Domain Expert) structure for methodology-heavy skills
- Shared standards already contain UX Research Methods and Quick Critique
- Skill should add decision guidance and practical application, not duplicate

**From 01-02-SUMMARY.md:**
- UX_PRINCIPLES.md already has UX Research Methods with usage percentages
- UX_PRINCIPLES.md already has Heuristic Evaluation Framework
- UX_PRINCIPLES.md already has Quick Critique Framework
- Skill should reference shared standards and add application guidance

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add UX Research Decision Guide</name>
  <files>skills/generic-ux-designer/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Add research decision guidance after Design Thinking Process:

**Research Decision Guide:**

1. **When to Research vs Ship:**
   | Situation | Action |
   |-----------|--------|
   | New product/feature | Full research (interviews + testing) |
   | Incremental change | Quick critique (heuristic review) |
   | Bug fix | No research needed |
   | A/B decision | Analytics + small test |
   | Controversial design | Stakeholder alignment first |

2. **Research Method Selection:**
   - Need user motivation? → Interviews
   - Need usability feedback? → Testing
   - Need quick quality check? → Heuristic evaluation
   - Need quantitative data? → Surveys/Analytics
   - Have no users yet? → Competitor analysis + proto-personas

3. **Research Scope by Confidence:**
   - High confidence (established pattern) → Skip research
   - Medium confidence → Quick critique
   - Low confidence (new territory) → Full research

4. **Reference:** See UX_PRINCIPLES.md for detailed method frameworks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add Practical Heuristic Application</name>
  <files>skills/generic-ux-designer/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Add practical heuristic application guidance:

**Heuristic Evaluation in Practice:**

1. **Quick Heuristic Scan (5 minutes):**
   Focus on these 5 most common issues:
   | Heuristic | Quick Check |
   |-----------|-------------|
   | Visibility | Is current state obvious? |
   | Feedback | Does every action have response? |
   | Consistency | Do similar things look/work similar? |
   | Error Prevention | Can user easily make mistakes? |
   | Recovery | Can user undo/fix errors? |

2. **Common Violations to Flag:**
   - Hidden system state (loading with no indicator)
   - Silent failures (action with no feedback)
   - Inconsistent patterns (different buttons for same action)
   - Destructive without confirm (delete with no undo)
   - Jargon in user-facing text

3. **How to Present Findings:**
   ```
   Issue: [What's wrong]
   Heuristic: [Which violated]
   Impact: [User consequence]
   Suggestion: [How to fix]
   Priority: [P0/P1/P2]
   ```

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add When to Use guidance and cross-references</name>
  <files>skills/generic-ux-designer/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
1. **Add "When to Use This Skill" section** at top:
   - Designing new features or flows
   - Improving existing user experience
   - Conducting design reviews/critiques
   - Evaluating user flows and interactions
   - Making accessibility decisions
   - Choosing between design alternatives

2. **Add "Don't Use When" guidance:**
   - Visual styling/tokens → use generic-design-system
   - Code architecture → use generic-feature-developer
   - Code quality review → use generic-code-reviewer

3. **Add UX Output Checklist** (self-critique):
   Before presenting UX recommendation:
   - [ ] User problem clearly defined
   - [ ] Solution addresses root cause (not symptom)
   - [ ] Accessibility considered
   - [ ] Edge cases identified
   - [ ] Implementation complexity noted
   - [ ] Success metrics defined

4. **Update See Also section:**
   - Add "READ UX_PRINCIPLES.md for:" with specific triggers
   - Add cross-references to design-system and feature-developer
   - Clarify skill boundaries

5. **Final validation:**
   - Verify 160-200 lines total
   - No duplication of UX_PRINCIPLES.md content
   - References point to shared standards correctly

Target: 180 lines final.
