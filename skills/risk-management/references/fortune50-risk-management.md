#### Risk Assessment and Scoring

**Qualitative Risk Assessment:**

**Likelihood Scale (1-5):**
- **1 - Rare**: May occur only in exceptional circumstances (<5% annual probability)
- **2 - Unlikely**: Could occur but not expected (5-20% annual probability)
- **3 - Possible**: Might occur at some time (20-50% annual probability)
- **4 - Likely**: Will probably occur (50-80% annual probability)
- **5 - Almost Certain**: Expected to occur in most circumstances (>80% annual probability)

**Impact Scale (1-5):**
- **1 - Insignificant**: Minimal financial loss (<$100K), no reputational impact, minor operational disruption
- **2 - Minor**: Small financial loss ($100K-$1M), limited reputational impact, some operational disruption
- **3 - Moderate**: Moderate financial loss ($1M-$10M), moderate reputational impact, significant operational disruption
- **4 - Major**: Large financial loss ($10M-$100M), major reputational impact, severe operational disruption
- **5 - Catastrophic**: Extreme financial loss (>$100M), severe reputational damage, business-threatening disruption

**Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact**

**Risk Matrix:**
```
Impact →
5  |  5  | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 |  EXTREME
4  |  4  |  8 | 12 | 16 | 20 |  HIGH
3  |  3  |  6 |  9 | 12 | 15 |  MEDIUM
2  |  2  |  4 |  6 |  8 | 10 |  LOW
1  |  1  |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  VERY LOW
   +------------------------+
      1    2    3    4    5
                  ↑ Likelihood
```

**Risk Categories:**
- **Extreme (20-25)**: Immediate action required, executive/board escalation
- **High (15-19)**: Senior management attention, detailed response plan
- **Medium (8-14)**: Management responsibility, monitor and manage
- **Low (4-7)**: Routine management, monitor
- **Very Low (1-3)**: Accept and monitor

---

**Quantitative Risk Assessment:**

**Expected Loss Calculation:**
```
Expected Annual Loss (EAL) =
  Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) × Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)

Where:
  SLE = Asset Value × Exposure Factor
  ARO = Number of expected occurrences per year
```

**Example:**
- Asset Value: $10M data center
- Exposure Factor: 60% (estimated loss in event)
- SLE: $10M × 0.60 = $6M
- ARO: 0.2 (once every 5 years)
- EAL: $6M × 0.2 = $1.2M per year

**Value at Risk (VaR):**
- Maximum expected loss over time period at given confidence level
- Example: "95% confidence that losses will not exceed $5M in next year"
- Used in financial risk management

**Monte Carlo Simulation:**
- Probabilistic modeling using repeated random sampling
- Generates distribution of possible outcomes
- Accounts for uncertainty and variability
- Software: @RISK, Crystal Ball, Python (NumPy, SciPy)

**Return on Security Investment (ROSI):**
```
ROSI = (Risk Mitigation Value - Cost of Solution) / Cost of Solution

Where:
  Risk Mitigation Value = (EAL Before - EAL After)
```

**Example:**
- EAL Before: $1.2M
- EAL After (with control): $200K
- Risk Mitigation Value: $1M
- Cost of Solution: $300K
- ROSI: ($1M - $300K) / $300K = 233%
