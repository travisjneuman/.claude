Use monetization-strategy for pricing advice
```

### Skill Tool

```
Skill(ios-development)
Skill(vue-development)
Skill(svelte-development)
Skill(graphic-design)
Skill(monetization-strategy)
```

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows this structure:

```
skills/
└── [skill-name]/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Main skill file (required)
    ├── references/       # Reference materials (optional)
    ├── assets/           # Templates, examples (optional)
    └── scripts/          # Helper scripts (optional)
```

### SKILL.md Format

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description for when Claude should use this skill
---
# Skill Title

Content with guidance, rules, patterns, examples...
```

---

## Creating New Skills

### 1. Create Folder

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/[skill-name]
```

### 2. Create SKILL.md

- YAML frontmatter with name and description
- Comprehensive content for Claude to follow
- Examples and patterns

### 3. Add References (Optional)

Place in `references/` folder for additional context.

### 4. Test

Verify skill activates when expected context appears.

## Skills vs Agents

| Feature        | Skills                       | Agents                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Purpose**    | Domain knowledge, guidelines | Specialized task execution |
| **Activation** | Automatic or explicit        | Explicit invocation        |
| **Scope**      | Main conversation            | Separate context           |
| **Best for**   | Knowledge, patterns          | Multi-step tasks           |

**Rule of thumb:** Use skills for guidance, agents for doing.

---

## Best Practices

### When to Create a Skill

- Repeated guidance needed
- Project-specific standards
- Complex domain knowledge
- Reusable patterns

### When NOT to Create a Skill

- One-time instructions
- Simple preferences (use CLAUDE.md)
- External tool integration (use MCP)

### Skill Content Tips

- Be comprehensive but focused
- Include concrete examples
- Reference other skills when relevant
- Keep updated as project evolves
