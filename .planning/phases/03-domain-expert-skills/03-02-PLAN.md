Output: 3 enhanced SKILL.md files with content split to references/ where needed.

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- P0/P1/P2 tiered structure prevents instruction overload (Phase 1)
- SKILL.md under 500 lines, split to references/ when approaching 400 (Phase 1)
- Task-focused descriptions for reliable activation (Research)

**Current skill sizes (audit targets):**
- hr-talent: 432 lines (under threshold, verify quality)
- leadership: 493 lines (under threshold but close - may need trim)
- health-wellness: 475 lines (under threshold but close - may need trim)

**Audit focus:**
- Not rebuilding - auditing and polishing
- Verify references/ folder exists for deep content
- Ensure SKILL.md under 500 lines (ideally <400)
- Confirm 3+ frameworks present
- Task-focused descriptions

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Audit and optimize hr-talent</name>
  <files>skills/hr-talent/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
    Read SKILL.md (432 lines) and run P0 checklist:
    1. Description is task-focused (lists capabilities, includes triggers)
    2. Under 500 lines (passes at 432)
    3. No padding/filler content - look for removable sections
    4. 3+ recognized frameworks present (check for real methodologies)
    5. Templates are actionable

    If padding found: Remove to bring under 400 lines.
    If no padding but >400: Consider references/ split.
    Document audit results.
