## MITRE ATT&CK Framework

```
ATTACK PHASES:

RECONNAISSANCE: Gather information
RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT: Obtain tools/infrastructure
INITIAL ACCESS: Get into network
EXECUTION: Run malicious code
PERSISTENCE: Maintain access
PRIVILEGE ESCALATION: Gain higher access
DEFENSE EVASION: Avoid detection
CREDENTIAL ACCESS: Steal credentials
DISCOVERY: Learn environment
LATERAL MOVEMENT: Move through network
COLLECTION: Gather target data
COMMAND AND CONTROL: Communicate with compromised systems
EXFILTRATION: Steal data
IMPACT: Damage/disrupt
```
