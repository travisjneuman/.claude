<objective>
Enhance generic-design-system with Atomic Design framework, design tokens structure, and component documentation standards.

Purpose: The current skill at 115 lines covers basics (colors, typography, spacing, animation) but lacks industry-standard frameworks. This plan adds structured patterns that Phase 4 stack variants will inherit.
Output: Enhanced generic-design-system SKILL.md with Atomic Design, design tokens, and component documentation (~150-180 lines).

**Phase 1 templates for reference:**
@.planning/templates/skill-enhancement-template.md
@.planning/templates/skill-quality-checklist.md

**Shared standards (enhanced in Phase 1):**
@skills/_shared/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md

**Current skill to enhance:**
@skills/generic-design-system/SKILL.md

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- Use Template A (Domain Expert) structure for design patterns
- Shared standards already contain Atomic Design basics - skill should reference not duplicate
- Token efficiency: reference _shared/ folder, don't duplicate content

**From 01-02-SUMMARY.md:**
- DESIGN_PATTERNS.md already has Atomic Design framework section
- DESIGN_PATTERNS.md already has Design Token Structure
- DESIGN_PATTERNS.md already has Component Documentation Standard
- Skill should reference shared standards and add skill-specific decision guidance

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Design System Architecture section</name>
  <files>skills/generic-design-system/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Add a new section after the intro that provides decision guidance:

**Design System Architecture:**

1. **When to Build vs Reference:**
   - Existing design system → Follow it strictly
   - No design system → Use this skill to establish foundations
   - Partial system → Identify gaps, extend consistently

2. **Token Organization Strategy:**
   - Primitive tokens (raw values): `--color-blue-500`
   - Semantic tokens (meaning): `--color-primary`
   - Component tokens (context): `--button-background`
   - Decision: Use semantic tokens in code, primitive tokens as foundation

3. **Consistency Decision Tree:**
   - If component exists → Use existing pattern
   - If similar exists → Adapt existing (don't create competing pattern)
   - If new category → Propose to user, document reasoning

This adds decision-making guidance missing from current skill.
Keep additions to ~30 lines.

  <verify>New "Design System Architecture" section present with 3 subsections</verify>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Enhance component section with states and variants</name>
  <files>skills/generic-design-system/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Enhance the Components section with states and accessibility:

1. **Add Component States table:**
   | State | Visual Treatment | Example |
   |-------|-----------------|---------|
   | Default | Base styling | Normal button |
   | Hover | Subtle feedback | Lighter/darker bg |
   | Active | Pressed state | Scaled down slightly |
   | Focus | Visible outline | 2px ring |
   | Disabled | Reduced opacity | 50% opacity, no pointer |
   | Loading | Spinner/skeleton | Button with spinner |
   | Error | Destructive color | Red border/text |

2. **Add Touch Target Requirements:**
   - Minimum 44x44px (WCAG 2.1)
   - 8px spacing between targets
   - Reference accessibility thresholds from DESIGN_PATTERNS.md

3. **Enhance Button variants table** to include touch target column

Keep additions to ~25 lines.
  </action>
  <verify>Component States table present, touch target requirements documented</verify>
  <done>Components section enhanced with states, touch targets, and accessibility</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add When to Use section and verify references</name>
  <files>skills/generic-design-system/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
1. **Add "When to Use This Skill" section** at the top (after intro):
   - Implementing UI components
   - Choosing colors or typography
   - Creating animations or transitions
   - Ensuring visual consistency
   - Setting up design tokens
   - Reviewing design system compliance

2. **Add "Don't Use When" guidance:**
   - UX flow design → use generic-ux-designer
   - Feature architecture → use generic-feature-developer
   - Code quality review → use generic-code-reviewer

3. **Verify and update See Also section:**
   - Ensure DESIGN_PATTERNS.md reference is correct
   - Add explicit "READ references when:" guidance
   - Add reference to generic-ux-designer for UX decisions

4. **Run final validation:**
   - Verify under 200 lines total
   - Check all links work
   - Ensure no duplication of _shared/ content

Target: 150-180 lines final.

  <verify>wc -l skills/generic-design-system/SKILL.md shows 150-200 lines, When to Use section present</verify>
  <done>Skill enhanced with usage guidance, cross-references verified, under 200 lines</done>
