**Capture Lessons Learned:**

- Refine integration approach for future deals
- Share best practices across corporate development team
- Incorporate into M&A training

---

## Best Practices Summary

### Due Diligence

1. **Start early:** Begin DD planning before LOI if possible
2. **Use checklists:** Comprehensive, consistent, nothing falls through cracks
3. **External experts:** Bring in specialists for financial, legal, IT, environmental
4. **Customer validation:** Always interview top customers
5. **Conservative assumptions:** Risk-adjust projections and synergies
6. **Red flag process:** Escalate issues immediately, don't bury bad news
7. **Integration mindset:** Think about Day 1 and integration during DD

### Integration

1. **Speed matters:** Faster integration = faster synergy realization
2. **Communicate relentlessly:** Over-communicate during uncertainty
3. **Retain key talent:** Identify and lock up critical employees
4. **Quick wins:** Deliver early successes to build momentum
5. **Cultural integration:** Don't underestimate, address proactively
6. **Governance:** Clear decision rights, regular cadence, accountability
7. **Track synergies:** Monthly scorecards, ownership, course-correct quickly

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Confirmation bias in DD (see what you want to see)
- Overpaying for "strategic" rationale without financial discipline
- Underestimating integration complexity and cost
- Neglecting cultural fit
- Losing key customers or employees during transition
- Over-synergizing (cutting too deep, hurting the business)
- Declaring victory too early (synergies take time to realize)

---

**Skill Maintenance:**

- Update checklists based on deal experience
- Incorporate regulatory changes (antitrust, tax, etc.)
- Refresh with recent M&A case studies
- Track industry best practices and emerging DD techniques
