## Token-Optimized Skill Structure

### Recommended Structure
- **SKILL.md**: Core guidance and frameworks (~5-10KB, under 500 lines)
  - Frontmatter: name (gerund form, lowercase-hyphen), description
  - First level: Name + description pre-loaded at startup (few dozen tokens)
  - Second level: Body loaded on-demand when skill triggered
  - Source: [Skill Authoring Best Practices](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices)

- **references/**: Deep-dive documentation, case studies, detailed frameworks
  - Don't consume tokens until explicitly read
  - Split mutually exclusive contexts into separate files
  - Unlimited size but must be relevant
  - Source: [Optimizing Token Efficiency in Claude Code](https://medium.com/@pierreyohann16/optimizing-token-efficiency-in-claude-code-workflows-managing-large-model-context-protocol-f41eafdab423)

- **scripts/**: Executable tools for automation
  - Run via bash without loading full contents into context
  - Only script output consumes tokens
  - Include when skill needs to process data, generate reports, or automate tasks
  - Source: [Claude Code Token Limits](https://www.faros.ai/blog/claude-code-token-limits)

### Size Thresholds
- **Core SKILL.md**: Target ~5-10KB for optimal performance
  - Keep under 500 lines; split into separate files if exceeding
  - Metadata consumes few dozen tokens even with many skills
  - Source: [How to Optimize Claude Code Token Usage](https://claudelog.com/faqs/how-to-optimize-claude-code-token-usage/)

- **Reference files**: No hard limit, but relevance is critical
  - Progressive disclosure: Only load what's needed
  - Example: 97% token savings by file-based analysis vs. inline JSON
  - Source: [Optimizing Token Efficiency](https://medium.com/@pierreyohann16/optimizing-token-efficiency-in-claude-code-workflows-managing-large-model-context-protocol-f41eafdab423)

### Progressive Disclosure Architecture
- **Level 1**: Metadata (name + description) pre-loaded at startup
- **Level 2**: SKILL.md body loaded on-demand when triggered
- **Level 3**: Reference files loaded only when explicitly needed
- **Level 4**: Scripts executed without loading contents (output only)
  - Source: [Skill Authoring Best Practices](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices)

### Optimization Strategies
- **Create compact files**: Lean, focused, single-purpose
- **Use CLAUDE.md**: Specify which files Claude can read, which directories are forbidden
- **Reusable prompts**: Templates in .claude/commands/ encapsulate complex workflows
- **Monitor usage**: Use /cost command to track token consumption patterns

## Quality Verification Approaches

### How to Verify "Expert-Level"

1. **Framework Validation**:
   - Cross-reference with recognized industry standards (MBB, Gartner, Forrester, etc.)
   - Confirm adoption by Fortune 50/500 companies
   - Verify through academic research (ACM, IEEE conferences)
   - Source: Multiple industry reports cited above

2. **Recency Check**:
   - Prioritize 2024-2025 sources for current best practices
   - Identify framework updates (e.g., NIST CSF 2.0 in Feb 2024)
   - Track emerging trends (AI integration, LSS 4.0, etc.)
   - Source: All search results dated 2024-2025

3. **Practitioner Adoption**:
   - Survey data showing usage percentages (e.g., 73% SaaS companies use MEDDIC)
   - Market growth statistics validating importance
   - Tool/platform integration support
   - Source: Industry surveys and market research cited above

4. **Measurable Outcomes**:
   - Quantified results from framework implementation
   - ROI data (e.g., LSS improving OEE by 6%, quality by 4-5%)
   - Time-to-proficiency metrics (e.g., MEDDIC: 3.6 months)
   - Source: Case studies and implementation reports

5. **Community Validation**:
   - Active plugin ecosystem (e.g., Pytest 1300+ plugins)
   - Professional association endorsement (UXPA, SHRM, etc.)
   - Conference proceedings and best paper awards
   - Source: Professional organization research

### Skill Quality Checklist

- [ ] Frameworks sourced from recognized authorities (McKinsey, BCG, Gartner, ISO, NIST, etc.)
- [ ] Content reflects 2024-2025 best practices (not outdated knowledge)
- [ ] Actionable guidance with clear "when to use" criteria
- [ ] Measurable outcomes or success metrics included
- [ ] Token-optimized structure (lean core + rich references)
- [ ] Progressive disclosure: Metadata → Core → Deep-dive
- [ ] Natural language triggers in description
- [ ] Consistent naming patterns (gerund form, lowercase-hyphen)
- [ ] Cross-domain integration where applicable (e.g., MEDDIC for Product + Sales)
- [ ] Sources cited for credibility and further learning

## Unanswered Questions

1. **ESG Frameworks**: Web search unavailable for GRI, SASB, TCFD current state
   - Used general knowledge instead; should verify 2024-2025 updates when available
   - Particularly important: ISSB standards adoption rates, CSRD implementation details

2. **Product Management Frameworks**: Web search unavailable for RICE, MoSCoW, ICE scoring
   - Used general knowledge instead; should verify current adoption trends
   - Particularly important: Framework preference by company size/stage

3. **Skill Interaction Patterns**: How skills should reference each other
   - Example: Should fortune50-sales include or reference fortune50-product-management content?
   - Guideline needed for cross-skill dependencies vs. duplication

4. **Token Budget Allocation**: What's the ideal distribution?
   - How much context for metadata vs. body vs. references?
   - When to split one large skill vs. create multiple smaller skills?

5. **Version Control**: How to handle framework updates?
   - Example: NIST CSF 1.1 → 2.0 happened Feb 2024; how to deprecate old content?
   - Should skills include version history or just current best practice?

6. **Skill Effectiveness Metrics**: How to measure if skill content is working?
   - Claude's output quality when using skill
   - Token efficiency gains
   - User satisfaction with skill-generated content

## Implementation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update all 16 domain expert skills** with frameworks identified above
2. **Standardize generic skills** with 2024-2025 best practices for code review, design systems, UX
3. **Create references/ directories** for deep-dive content to keep SKILL.md files lean
4. **Add "When to Use" sections** to each skill for clear triggering criteria
5. **Cite sources** in reference files for credibility and further learning

### Quality Assurance
1. **Peer review** by domain experts where possible
2. **Test triggers** with natural language queries to verify skill activation
3. **Token audit** to ensure under 500 lines for core SKILL.md files
4. **Quarterly updates** to incorporate new frameworks and deprecate outdated content

### Future Research (When Search Available)
1. ESG frameworks current state (GRI, SASB, ISSB adoption)
2. Product management framework trends (RICE, MoSCoW usage statistics)
3. Emerging frameworks in each domain (2025-2026 trends)

---

**Research Quality Notes:**
