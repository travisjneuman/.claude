## Subscription Models

### Pricing Tiers

```
GOOD-BETTER-BEST Framework:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BASIC (Good)                            │
│ Entry point, core features only         │
│ Price anchor, volume driver             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ PROFESSIONAL (Better) ← Target tier     │
│ Most popular, best value                │
│ Features most users need                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ENTERPRISE (Best)                       │
│ Premium features, support, SLAs         │
│ High-value customers, custom pricing    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Typical ratio: 1x : 2.5x : 6x+ pricing
```

### SaaS Metrics

| Metric    | Formula                                 | Target      |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **MRR**   | Monthly Recurring Revenue               | Growing     |
| **ARR**   | MRR × 12                                | Growing     |
| **ARPU**  | Revenue / Users                         | Increasing  |
| **Churn** | Lost Revenue / Total                    | <5% monthly |
| **LTV**   | ARPU × Average Lifespan                 | > 3× CAC    |
| **CAC**   | Sales+Marketing / New Customers         | < ⅓ LTV     |
| **NRR**   | (Start MRR + Expansion - Churn) / Start | >100%       |

### Subscription Best Practices

```
DO:
✓ Offer annual discount (15-20%)

## Freemium Models

### Freemium Types

| Type                | Free Tier Limit | Examples           |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| **Feature-limited** | Core only       | Slack, Notion      |
| **Usage-limited**   | Quantity caps   | Mailchimp, Dropbox |
| **Time-limited**    | Trial period    | Netflix, Spotify   |
| **Seat-limited**    | User count      | Figma, Zoom        |
| **Support-limited** | Community only  | Open source tools  |

### Conversion Funnel

```
Free Users (100%)
     │
     ▼
Active Users (40-60%)
     │
     ▼
Engaged Users (10-20%)
     │
     ▼
Conversion Ready (3-5%)
     │
     ▼
Paid Users (2-5%)

Target: 2-5% free-to-paid conversion
Top performers: 10%+
```

### Designing the Free Tier

```
Free tier should:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Deliver real value (not crippled)     │
│ ✓ Showcase premium features naturally   │
│ ✓ Create habit/dependency               │
│ ✓ Encourage sharing/virality            │
│ ✓ Cost nearly nothing to serve          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Upgrade triggers:
- Usage limits (storage, API calls)
- Collaboration (team features)
- Advanced features (analytics, exports)
- Support (priority, SLA)
- Integration (API access, SSO)
```

## Pricing Psychology

### Key Principles

| Principle             | Application                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Anchoring**         | Show expensive option first         |
| **Decoy**             | Add inferior option to guide choice |
| **Charm pricing**     | $99 vs $100                         |
| **Round pricing**     | $100 for premium feel               |
| **Price bundling**    | Combined value perception           |
| **Left-digit effect** | $3.99 seems much less than $4       |

### Price Presentation

```
DO:
✓ Highlight "most popular" option
✓ Show savings for annual plans
✓ Use social proof at each tier
✓ Display price per user/month
✓ List features in value order

DON'T:
✗ Too many tiers (max 4)
✗ Overwhelming feature lists
✗ Hide important limitations
✗ Make comparison difficult
```

### The Decoy Effect

```
Without decoy:
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Basic $10   │ Pro $25     │  Most choose Basic
└─────────────┴─────────────┘

With decoy:
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Basic $10   │ Plus $24    │ Pro $25     │
│ 5 features  │ 8 features  │ 15 features │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
                              ↑
                    Now Pro looks like best value
```

---

## Pricing Strategy

### Cost-Based vs. Value-Based

```
COST-BASED:
Price = Costs + Desired Margin

Problem: Ignores what customers will pay
Use when: Commoditized market, thin margins

VALUE-BASED:
Price = Customer's perceived value × capture %

Better because: Captures willingness to pay
Use when: Differentiated product, clear value
```

### Value-Based Pricing Process

```
Step 1: Understand customer's alternative
        What would they pay without you?

Step 2: Quantify your differentiated value
        How much better/faster/cheaper?

Step 3: Calculate customer's willingness to pay
        What % of value can you capture?

Example:
- Alternative costs customer $1000/month
- Your solution saves 50% ($500/month value)
- Capture 30% of value = $150/month price
```

### Pricing Research Methods

| Method                  | How It Works          | Accuracy |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| **Van Westendorp**      | Ask 4 price questions | Medium   |
| **Conjoint Analysis**   | Trade-off choices     | High     |
| **A/B Testing**         | Test live prices      | Highest  |
| **Competitor Analysis** | Market benchmarks     | Low      |
| **Customer Interviews** | Qualitative insight   | Low      |

### Van Westendorp Questions

```
Ask potential customers:
1. At what price would it be too expensive?
2. At what price would it be too cheap (suspicious)?
3. At what price would it be getting expensive but still okay?
4. At what price would it be a bargain?

Plot responses to find optimal price range.

## Revenue Optimization

### Expansion Revenue

```
Paths to expansion:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ UPSELL: Upgrade to higher tier          │
│ CROSS-SELL: Additional products         │
│ ADD-ONS: Premium features à la carte    │
│ SEATS: More users on account            │
│ USAGE: Pay for increased usage          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Goal: Net Revenue Retention > 100%
Top companies: 120-150% NRR
```

### Reducing Churn

```
PROACTIVE MEASURES:
- Track engagement health scores
- Identify at-risk accounts early
- Reach out before renewal
- Offer value consultations
- Build switching costs (integrations)

REACTIVE MEASURES:
- Exit surveys (learn why)
- Pause option vs. cancel
- Downgrade path available
- Win-back campaigns
```

### Failed Payment Recovery

```
DUNNING SEQUENCE:
Day 0:  Payment fails → Auto-retry
Day 1:  Email: "Update payment method"
Day 3:  Email: "Action required"
Day 7:  Email: "Service interruption soon"
Day 14: Downgrade to free / pause
Day 30: Account suspension

Recovers 30-50% of failed payments
```

## Marketplace Monetization

### Take Rate Models

| Model                 | Typical Rate        | Examples          |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Transaction fee**   | 5-20%               | Uber, Airbnb      |
| **Listing fee**       | Fixed per listing   | eBay, Etsy        |
| **Subscription**      | Monthly for sellers | Amazon FBA        |
| **Featured/Promoted** | Pay for visibility  | Indeed, Zillow    |
| **Hybrid**            | Multiple streams    | Most marketplaces |

### Two-Sided Pricing

```
Consider charging:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SUPPLY SIDE (Sellers/Providers)         │
│ - Transaction fee %                     │
│ - Subscription for tools                │
│ - Promoted listings                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ DEMAND SIDE (Buyers/Users)              │
│ - Service/booking fee                   │
│ - Premium membership                    │
│ - Delivery/convenience fees             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Subsidize the harder side to acquire.
```

## B2B Pricing

### Enterprise Considerations

```
PRICING FACTORS:
- Company size (seats, revenue)

- Custom enterprise quotes
```

### Sales-Assisted Pricing

```
When to use custom pricing:
- Deal size > $10K ARR
- Complex requirements
- Long sales cycle
- Multiple stakeholders
- Custom implementation

Structure:
Platform fee + Per-seat/usage + Support tier
```

### Volume Discounts

```
TIERED PRICING:
1-10 seats:    $50/seat/month
11-50 seats:   $45/seat/month
51-100 seats:  $40/seat/month
100+ seats:    Custom

Or percentage discounts:
Annual prepay: 15-20% off
Multi-year:    25-30% off
```

## Consumer Pricing

### Mobile App Monetization

| Model                | Description             | Typical Revenue |

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Avoid pay-to-win
- Disclose odds for random items
- Protect minors
- Cap spending options
```

## International Pricing

### Localization Strategies

| Strategy                    | Approach                     | Complexity |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Single global price**     | Same USD everywhere          | Low        |
| **Currency conversion**     | Local currency, same value   | Medium     |
| **Purchasing power parity** | Adjusted by market           | High       |
| **Market-specific**         | Different prices per country | Highest    |

### PPP Considerations

```
Example adjustments (relative to US):
USA:         100%
UK:          95%
Germany:     90%
Brazil:      50%
India:       30%
Nigeria:     25%

Reduces revenue per user but:
- Increases addressable market
- Reduces piracy in price-sensitive markets
- Builds brand in emerging markets
```

---

## Pricing Experiments

### A/B Testing Pricing

```
WHAT TO TEST:
- Price points
- Tier structure
- Feature allocation
- Annual vs. monthly
- Trial length
- Discount strategies

CAUTIONS:
- Legal issues (different prices for same product)
- Customer trust if discovered
- Statistical significance requirements
- Long-term vs. short-term effects
```

### Grandfather Pricing

```
When raising prices:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Option 1: Grandfather existing users    │
│ - Keep their current price forever      │
│ - Or for 12-24 months                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Option 2: Phase in increases            │
│ - 50% of increase now, 50% in 6 months  │
│ - With advance notice                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Option 3: Direct increase               │
│ - Give 30-90 days notice                │
│ - Explain value added                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Best Practices

### DO:

- Research willingness to pay before setting prices
- Start higher than you think (easier to discount than raise)

### DON'T:

- Race to the bottom on price
- Copy competitor pricing blindly
- Offer too many tiers/options
